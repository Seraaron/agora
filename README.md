# Agora - A Free Tabletop Roleplaying Game - By Seraaron

Welcome to the Agora github repo! Here you'll find the directory of all my work so far, which will eventually include all content and resources for the game so that it's all in one place for easy access.

## This game is a work in progress!

Right now, the only thing availiable is the published SRD or 'system reference document' which is an assortment of markdown files **intended to be used with the [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) app**. _Stictly speaking, you should only need to download these files if you want to contribute to the project, or make edits to core rules for your own custom game or homebrew hacks._

### Please visit https://publish.obsidian.md/agora for a free online preview of all the availiable content.

## Changelogs

### Alpha version

#### 12 Nov 2021
- Check difficulties changed to be graduated and failure forward (making them more variable, but also more predictable, since Tasks have ended up being more binary in their use).
- You can now also KISS checks (instead of the weird auto-success mechanic I had before), and you can also add a single asset or piece of gear to a check.
- A 'stressful' modifier can now be applied to rolls, which means you take stress damage if you fail (upping the stakes, but not the difficulty).
- Tasks article slightly shortened and 'Fates Offering' was removed.
- Special hinderance rules for multiple hinderers removed.
- Help now means that your ally can KISS your dice for you.
- You now gain exp on Tasks for the first Lot spent when KISSing.
- Name changes for Hunger to Fatigue (Endurance stress) and for Fatigue to Burnout (Resolve stress).
- Tidied up the kismet and principles advice sections.
- Adjusted the combat rule and started writing social conflict system.
- I'm starting to add 'next article' and 'previous article' links to the bottom of every page to hopefully make navigating the wiki in a linear order a little easier for those that want to read it like a book.

#### 13 Oct 2021
- Initial public release
