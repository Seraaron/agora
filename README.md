# Agora - A Free Tabletop Roleplaying Game - By Seraaron

Welcome to the Agora github repo! Here you'll find the directory of all my work so far, which will eventually include all content and resources for the game so that it's all in one place for easy access.

## This game is a work in progress!

Right now, the only thing availiable is the published SRD or 'system reference document' which is an assortment of markdown files **intended to be used with the [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) app**. _Stictly speaking, you should only need to download these files if you want to contribute to the project, or make edits to core rules for your own custom game or homebrew hacks._

### Please visit https://publish.obsidian.md/agora for a free online preview of all the availiable content.

#### 5 Dec 2021 (v0.3.2)
- Updated metadata and tags on all articles
- Embedded job subsystems into their own articles to make searching easier
- A few weapons updates
- Updated social and martial combat systems based on playtesting and feedback:
    - Presence calculation is slightly simplified
    - Composure renamed to Disposition (and this name is also shared with martial combat now too, so Stamina will also be renamed to  Disposition)
    - Add Health to Disposition roll, so you're less screwed if you don't have one of the two jobs.
    - Momentum gains +1 at 5, and every 10 momentum thereafter (though the grid graphic hasn't been updated yet).
    - Tones grant flat momentum each round, and you can no longer change tone mid round except via an exploit.
    - Speechlessness doesn't force you to skip a turn anymore, but you're still kinda incentivized to do so, as it instead drops your Presence  to 0 until the end of the round you next take a turn on.
    - Turns taken on tied disposition now resolve simultanously.
    - You can't take the same move twice in a row (so no more double question or double dismiss)
    - Exploits have been reworded, so they're from your perspective not the target's.
    - Detract has been renamed Chide, and Dismiss has been renamed Conclude 
    - Some moves now give bonus dice depending on what tone your opponent is currently in.
    - You can now conclude from any tone, just the type of conclusion changes.

#### 28 Nov 2021 (v0.3.1)

- Updated job descriptions and added specific factors.
- Also included some small subsystems like alchemy, crafting, and building.
- Magic jobs still need finishing.
- Other tweaks and fixes.


#### 17 Nov 2021 (v0.3)
- Added 'Social Discourse' -- which is a modified version of the combat rules that introduce rhetorical theory.
- Updated martial combat (minor tweaks)

#### 12 Nov 2021 (v0.2)
- Check difficulties changed to be graduated and failure forward (making them more variable, but also more predictable, since Tasks have ended up being more binary in their use).
- You can now also KISS checks (instead of the weird auto-success mechanic I had before), and you can also add a single asset or piece of gear to a check.
- A 'stressful' modifier can now be applied to rolls, which means you take stress damage if you fail (upping the stakes, but not the difficulty).
- Tasks article slightly shortened and 'Fates Offering' was removed.
- Special hinderance rules for multiple hinderers removed.
- Help now means that your ally can KISS your dice for you.
- You now gain exp on Tasks for the first Lot spent when KISSing.
- Name changes for Hunger to Fatigue (Endurance stress) and for Fatigue to Burnout (Resolve stress).
- Tidied up the kismet and principles advice sections.
- Adjusted the combat rule and started writing social conflict system.
- Starting to add 'next article' and 'previous article' links to the bottom of every page to hopefully make navigating the wiki in a linear order a little easier for those that want to read it like a book.

#### 13 Oct 2021 (v0.1)
- Initial public release
