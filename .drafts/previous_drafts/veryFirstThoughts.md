# Only roll dice when something is at stake

## Tasks are Slow and Complicated
Use a pool of ten-sided dice (D10s) equal to your skill level plus any modifiers, and count successes for each dice that landed beneath or equal to the rank of the associated ability. For this purpose, 0s count as 0s.

Alternatively, if you aren't fond of roll-under systems: Roll the pool and add the ability's rank to each die separately, and count successes for each total equal to or greater than 10. For this purpose, 0s count as 10s.

Decide before beginning play which system you will be using. They are probabalistically identical, so each player may choose to use a different system, so long as they are self-consistent.

In either case, compare the number of successes to the difficulty of the task.

### Difficulty is Negotiable

#### Negotiating down to 0 mean automatic success

## Checks are Quick and Dirty
Roll 1D20 and add the results to your ability rank and any other modifiers (not skills), and compare the total to the difficulty of the check. Determining the difficulty of the check follows the same rules as tasks, except that the final difficulty value is multiplied by three to give you the target to meet or exceed with your die roll. If the difficulty is negotiated down to zero then there is no need to make a check: you automatically succeed. Similarly, if you roll a natural 20 then you automatically succeed.

| Difficulty | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| :--------: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Check â‰¥   | 0   | 3   | 6   | 9   | 12  | 15  | 18  | 21  | 24  | 27  | 30  |

### There are no 'criticals' or 'fumbles'
Checks have no inbetween difficulties nor any notion of margin of successes or failure they are simply used to answer binary questions: did you pass or fail, hit or miss, fly or fall?

If you failed, you may spend up to a single lot on the check to reroll the die.

You cannot spend ego on checks.

## The GM does not perform tasks or checks

## Contests aren't rolled

## Actions Have Consequences

### Always respond to the result

#### If at first you don't succeed, x

# Character Sheet Components
## Lots
You can have up to 10 lots at any given time. You can use glass beads or some other physical token to represent how many lots you currently have.

You can throw your lots into any die roll to help affect the outcome. Each lot spent lets you either reroll a die of your choice, or make all 0s rolled count as successes twice.

### Each die can only be re-rolled once
All the lots you intend to spend on a task must be declared before any dice are rerolled. You can't spend any more lots on a task after any dice are rerolled.

Lots are claimed back during the 'postamble' segment of each session, by advocating for your actions (more on this later).

## Ego turns a task into a check
'Ego' is more binary: at any given time, you either have it or you don't. You can flip a playing card or use another physical token to represent whether you still have your ego or not.

When it looks like you've failed to perform a task, even after spending your lots (if any), you may spend your ego to try one last time by turning the task into a check: clear the previous dice off the table, and roll a d20 as per the rules for making a check, keeping the same difficulty. This roll may not have have lots spent on it unless the first didn't either. 

Your ego automatically regenerates at the end of each session.
