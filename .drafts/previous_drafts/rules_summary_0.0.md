# Venus Engine Playsheet / Procedure Cheatsheet

## When to Roll Dice, and how?
1. Always first, work out what your agenda is each turn and how you would like to work towards it.
2. Roleplay until you reach a point of tension or indecision, until you attempt something that could have interesting consequences, or until the GM pauses you to discuss the current intent of your actions.
3. Once your agenda is clear to your Peers, the GM will state the failure consequences for the action and which ability should be used, and decide whether the roll should be performed as a simple **check** or a full **task**.

***Note:*** Sometimes, no roll is even necessary to do what you want to do; we do not roll when there is nothing at stake. In this case, the GM may pass your turn to keep a good session pace, or you can pass the turn yourself when you're ready.

#### Who are your Peers?
Your Peers are everyone else at the table, except you. It is a relative term. So the GM's Peers are all their players, including you. Even then, a Peer may not even need to be a player; they might just be a friend sitting in on the session and listening. Peers are expected to help the GM adjudate the game rules when it's not their turn in the spotlight: This reduces the referencial and managerial duties of the GM, so that they can focus on creating and directing the game for you.

### Checks are Binary, and use a single d20
1. Your Peers will give you a target to hit with your roll:
    - This is a number based on an *absolute difficulty* evaluated between 1 and 4, and multiplied by 5, as judged by your Peers.
      - So 'very easy' checks start with a target of 5, and 'very hard' checks start at 20.
    - The GM may also add up to four *relative difficulty* factors, each rated +1 or +2 — such as environmental hazards, or the lifepaths and special attributes of an opponent, or any aid they receive — to give you a final target between 5 and 28.
2. Check your ability's *rank* and then roll a d20:
    - If the rank is Bronze ($Br$) and the die naturally lands on a 20 then you automatically pass the check and succeed at your task, *regardless of the actual target*.
    - If the rank is Silver ($Si$) then you automatically pass on a 19 or 20. If it's Gold ($Go$) then you auto-pass on an 18, 19, or 20. And Platinum ($Pl$) abilities auto-pass on a 17 through to 20.
    - But conversely, if you get a natural 1, then you automatically fail the check, *despite any and all bonuses*.
3. Now, if you haven't already passed with the natural roll, then add your ability *score* to the result.
    - You pass the check when the sum meets or exceeds the target number!
4. If you're falling short of the target, then do not depair, you can make up the difference with your own factors:
    - Up to four bonus factors may be added to your result: In the form of environmental benefits, your relevant lifepaths, special attributes, or aid from allies. Check with your Peers that each factor is valid.
    - Add +1 to your sum for each factor, or +2 if multiples of a given factor are deemed to be applicable.
      - Up to a maximum total bonus of +8.
5. But if your total still misses the target, then alas, you fail the check.

***Note:*** Checks are supposed to be used to resolve simple actions quickly and easily. If you or any of your Peers feel you are digging too deeply for bonuses, or that either your action or agenda has shifted, or that the stakes are perhaps much higher than you first realized, then the GM can cancel the check or offer to switch the roll to a task instead. Though some actions are so simple that they *really must* be performed with a check. And you can't spend kismet — lots or ego — on a check either.

#### Rank vs. Score
**Rank** represents your potential to succeed as raw talent, whereas **score** represents your training and growth.
- Rank is determined by a combination of your tier and special features; and does not typically change very much after character assembly, unless you accomplish great feats through play, or the tone of game shifts dramatically.
- Score is determined by your age and lifepath choices; and typically only changes when a lot of time passes in game, or if you get badly injured.
- So advancement comes predominately from earning new attributes — assets, features, and specialties — that can be applied to a broader array of checks, or by making new friends who will lend you their aid.

### Tasks are Variable, and use a pool of D10s
1. Choose a job that can 'inherit' the ability chosen by the GM for the task, and add it's level to your ability score.
    - This is how many D10's you will roll for the task, and the inherited rank will determine your pass range for each die (see step 4).
2. Your Peers will then determine a difficulty threshold for you to overcome with your roll:
    - The starting threshold is based on the *appropriate difficulty* given your chosen job and the task at hand, rated 1-4:
      - Sometimes this figure can be looked up for specific jobs and tasks, but it's usually context-dependent.
      - If your Peers think that your job is completely inappropriate, then you must use a different job of *their choice*, or start learning it if you do not have it (see below).
    - The GM may also add up to four *relative difficulty* factors, each rated +1 or +2 — such as environmental hazards, a rank difference between you and an opponent's abilities, or any aid they receive, or other contextual disadvantages  — to give you a final threshold between 1 and 12.
    - There is usually a lot of meta-discussion happening in this step; but that's okay, because we want to be abolustely sure of the conditions of the test before moving forwards.
3. Up to three allies may now offer you one of their dice as aid if they have an appropriate or relevant job — be warned though, this will tie them to the consequences of your actions — so it's up to you whether to accept them.
    - For this reason, it's handy if everyone at the table uses different colored dice, so then you can see how much each ally helped you, but this isn't *wholly* necessary as long as everyone rolls separately.
4. Now roll your D10s, and any allies should do the same, and each count passes based on their ability's rank:
    - The pass range of Bronze ($Br$) dice is rolls of 7, 8, 9 or 10. Silver ($Si$) dice pass on a 6 or more, Gold ($Go$) on 5-10, and Platinum ($Pl$) on a 4+.
    - Also, if you are performing magic as part of the task — usually indicated by a tenacious attribute — or using sufficiently advanced technology, then any 10s you rolled will explode:
      - Meaning you should roll another die for each 10 and add the result on top of what's already been rolled, and any 10s they roll can explode too. Potentially *ad infinitum!*
5. If the sum of all passes does not meet or exceed the threshold, then you can 'KISS' individual dice — using kismet, insight, stunts or specialties — to re-roll them:
    - This means you can spend your lots, apply knowledge or secrets that've been established through play, raise the stakes of the roll by attempting something extra, or use any $Sp$ attributes that should apply to the task, given the context and your Peer's approval.
      - Then *let fate decide* if any of that actually helps you, by re-rolling one die for each KISS.
    - You cannot KISS an ally's dice, but they can KISS their own; since they are tied to the stakes of this task now, they should be able to leverage anything they can think of too. 
    - Each die can only be KISSed once, and all advocacy for KISSes should be done before picking up any dice. There is only one round of KISSing.
6. If you still do not have enough passes to succeed at the task, then your last resort may be to spend your ego:
   - This makes *any and all* 10s rolled, by either yourself or your allies, count *twice* as passes.
   - But since all other avenues are exhausted before this point, you should be able to easily tell if it's worth it to spend you precious ego.
7. Otherwise you fail at the task and suffer the consequences — be they immediate or gradual — but at least you get to mark a point of $exp$ for the job that you used, and any allies can mark $exp$ for the job that they lent aid with.
   - When your total $exp$ for that job is equal to twice the current level of that job, then wipe the slate clean and increase your job level by 1.

***Note:*** Some tasks may also have 'critial failure' or 'critial success' effects, when you either fail by half of the threshold or succeed by double, respectfully. Other tasks may only care about the margin of success or failure; meaning, for example, if you get 6 successes on a threshold 4 task, then you succeed by 150% and may be rewarded appropriately. This all usually depends on your agenda, context, and the conditions established prior to rolling.

#### Only players perform Tasks
Because of both the time and emotional investments required of performing tasks, we almost never care about seeing NPCs performing them. Instead, they can either perform checks, or the scene should be re-framed so that a player leads the task and the NPC helps or hinders them. So when fighting against enemies, for example: you would generally perform Finesse checks to hit them, and Swiftness checks to dodge or parry.

### Learning on the Job
1. While performing a task, if you are told by your Peers to use a job that you don't have (see above), then you must start learning that new job from scratch.
2. Add the job to your sheet at level 0, and treat it for all intents and purposes as though it were any other job, except that:
   - You cannot offer aid with a level zero job.
   - And after performing a task — regardless of success or failure — mark an $exp$.
     - This is *in addition* to usual $exp$ you'd get from failing, so can it can take 8-16 tasks total to learn a new job. 
   - *Unless* the job has specific requirements to learn:
     - Then you do not mark *any* $exp$ until those conditions are met.
     - Which can potentially keep you at level zero indefinitely.
3. Once you have filled the bar with a total of 16 $exp$, then you can finally clean the slate, and the job advances to your minimum job level — equal to your character tier:
   - Which is level 1 for 'Historic' peoples, level 2 for 'Heroic' characters, level 3 for 'Mythic' entities, and level 4 for 'Deific' beings.
