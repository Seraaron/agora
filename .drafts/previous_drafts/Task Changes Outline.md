### The Problem(s)

- Tasks are either too easy for the player, or too hard for the FC to make difficult, or both:
	- weighing the difference between absolute vs relative difficulties vs splitting an agenda into multiple objectives is too many things to consider, and the statistical effects of each are unclear
	- consequences don't seem concrete
	- and/or pushing for multiple objectives has no draw-backs
- KISSes are OP:
	- It's too easy to come up with a full set of kisses for every roll
	- Lots and ego are very strong
		- though this may resolve itself in long-term play
		- (people act differently in one-shots)
	- But specialties and insight are definitely the most interesting ways to KISS
	- Some people don't like stunts, but I do.
		- The way stunts are currently implemented is the best possible way to implement them, as far as I can tell
			- Alternatives like stunting before rolling are not viable
		- So I don't think there's a resolution to this one, other than just saying that some groups may choose to not use stunts
			- Consider it a difficulty modifier: if you allow stunts, the game is easier and the tone is a little different
			- and KIS, with one S, doesn't break the acronym

### The Solution

- **Reduce the number of levers the FC can pull on, and put one of those levers in the hands of the player:**
	- Remove absolute difficulty and make relative factors the number of successes needed for the main-objective
	- Change side-objectives to spend dice before the roll 
	- Only add Health dice to rolls where your life is threatened
- Don't substantially change KISSes (yet)
	- yes, re-rolls are very powerful,
		- but not more powerful than rolling more dice in the first place
	- If the solution above does not simultaneously solve the KISSing problem then I'll come back to it and have another think

#### Explanations:

##### Remove absolute difficulty and make relative factors the number of successes needed for the main-objective?

Remove absolute difficulty, because it's kind of an arbitrary toggle, and if the FC wants to make a roll more difficult they can just add more factors (and possibly spending Lots if they want to).

Minimum target is 1, factors add to that.

Change relative factors to be the total number of successes that the PC must roll to get everything they wanted. This is more like other games, since the total basically becomes a target to meet. But hopefully, because the difficulty is built up and explained before the roll, we still keeps a sense of partial successes when some factors are overcome but others aren't.

And the FC should lay out *a consequence that occurs if all the factors aren't overcome*.

> Eg. I want to kill a guy, but I must over come three factors: the difficult terrain, the man's sheer strength, and my unfamiliarity with his style of fighting. So the target is 4. If I fail then he kills me. I get 2 successes, and so I die, but I can describe my death in more detail because we know what factors were at play:
> ⋄ I overcame his strength and skill, but then tripped on a rock.
> ⋄ I kept a level footing and fended off his fancy blows, but then he came in with a powerful chop that I simply couldn't parry.
> ⋄ etc.

Basically, because difficulty factors are pre-established, the dice results give us fun clues for how to describe failures.

##### Change side-objectives to spend dice before roll?

Let the player achieve independent 'side-objectives' by spending their dice before the roll. Possibly chosen from a list? But probably made up on the spot because it's more fun.

No roll needed: If they're willing to spend a die, then *it just happens*. 

In some cases this can help subdue the worst possible outcome of the main objective, but there's always trade-off here because you're sacrificing potential success on the main objective for definite success on something secondary, which raises the stakes but also reassures you that you'll get *something* out of the roll.

This is an interesting solution though, because it's almost self-moderating... Players will be more likely to push for side-objectives when they know they have a lot of dice, and so in turn they have less dice, and less opportunity to KISS; but they get something solid *and immediate* in return. Similar to "devil's bargain" in some ways, maybe?

> Eg. I want to win at a contest (MO), but I'm also cheating at the contest and don't want to get caught (SO), and even if I don't win at the contest I *at least* want to beat my brother (SO). So with two side objectives, I sacrifice two dice before the roll to ensure those things are true. Then try to win the contest with the remaining dice, which I've just made harder for myself.

What counts as the main objective and what counts as side objectives depends on context, the agenda, and the job used, probably.

This may still run into a similar problem as before where the FC can make stuff harder for the player by introducing side-consequences that they feel they *have to* buy off. But depends on how I word it. Maybe make it so only players can introduce side objectives?

##### Only add Health dice to rolls where your life is threatened?

No minimum dice pool size now, since we're not subtracting dice in the same way (and probably change Checks to just always roll two dice, rather than rolling health).

Instead, when there are deathly consequences, you get to add your Health dice to the roll. Representing, like, pulling on all your resources and adrenaline in a desperate moment. And if you still fail the main task, then you have to spend Health and take a wound to not die.

> Eg. in the first example, fighting the man, I'd get +2 dice for the roll, but if I still got less than 3 successes then I'm dead unless I spend one of my health dice.

##### Only earn *exp* on failed Tasks (again)?

Since it's now clearer to define what a fully succeeded Task is, we can probably go back to a 'learning from mistakes' exp model;

but possibly add the option to sacrifice a die before the roll to guarantee exp? (As in, they'd get exp regardless of success or failure on the main roll, not bonus exp on a failed roll; so the only reason you'd do this to yourself if if you have a ton of dice and you're feeling bold).

### Potential downsides to this solution

- Makes the objectives / subverting consequences idea from an earlier iteration more obscure, or at least makes the dice pool system more 'traditional'.

- Middle step with the side-objectives could still be messy in practice, and might not have good 'game feel'.

- Nothing to spend extra successes on beyond the main objective.

- May not full resolve the issues with KISSes.

- Health is less front-and-center in every roll.

### In conclusion: Needs playtesting.
