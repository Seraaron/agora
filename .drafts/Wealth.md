### Wealth

Wealth is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that abstractly represents your material possessions, monetary affluence, and ease of access to other resources.

Use Wealth in games about accruing riches, or in games that explore wealth inequality as a central theme, especially in highly capitalistic or feudal settings. If you care about using money in your game, but don't want to track individual coins and pennies, then use Wealth.

#### Rolling Wealth

When you want to purchase something, make a Wealth check. The difficulty of this check will depend on what it is that your buying, and whether your [[Peers]] think that it is within your 'budget' or not, which will itself depend on your Wealth rank:

- **Easy** — the purchase is within your budget.
- **Normal** — the purchase is just within your budget.
- **Hard** — the purchase will exceed your budget.

Failure in this case doesn't mean that you don't get to buy the thing you wanted; rather, if you fail a check then you may still complete the purchase, but gain debt in the process.

**Important:** Since both Wealth rank and budget are co-dependent it means that Wealth tests are doubly-easier the richer your are, and doubly-harder the poorer you are. This is a feature, not a bug.

#### Deriving Wealth

Your Wealth rank is _purely based_ on your economic / social class, as judged by your [[Peers]], based on your [[Circumstances|circumstances]] and lifestyle choices (during play):

> **Rank Examples:**
>
> 1.  **A god of riches and fortune**; or the _effective-sovereign_ of one of the wealthiest nations in the world.
> 2.  **A true blue-blood**; greater nobility; a warlord or dictator; or the chief executive of a mercantile empire; the 1%.
> 3.  **Born to wealth and sworn to fealty**; lesser nobility, living off inheritance, investments, or exploitation; a viceroy, chancellor, or guild-master; or a robber-baron.
> 4.  **Full records, insurance, and regular savings**; a master artisan or low-born aristocrat; a residential merchant; a knight or a professional-soldier; or a criminal kingpin.
> 5.  **Enough savings for emergencies and special occasions**; a guild-member, or superintendent; an itinerant trader, adventurer, or wandering mercenary, just starting to turn a profit; or a professional thug.
> 6.  **Living just within your means**; free but poor, or caged in comfort; a nomadic hunter or subsistence farmer; an apprentice, student, or hustler; a seasonal-soldier; an occasional thief; or just down on your luck.
> 7.  **Kept beneath the poverty line**; an indentured servant, a prisoner, or a slave; a vagrant, a fugitive, or untouchable.
