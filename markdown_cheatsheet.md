**"A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."**
# Text
## Paragraph
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

This is another paragraph.

## Font Style
It's very easy to make some words *italic* and other words **bold**.

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

Words surrounded by two equals signs ==are highlighted== 

If you'd like to quote someone, use the `>` character before the line:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> This is the second paragraph.

### Extra Formatting
<sup>This is some superscript text</sup> and <sub>this is some subscript text.</sub>

this is left-aligned text (default)
<div style="text-align: center">this is center-aligned text (requires html)</div>
<div style="text-align: right">this is right-aligned text (requires html)</div>

But too much text-alignment and sub/super-scripts goes against the core philosophy of markdown files (stated at the top of this file), and snippets of html code aren't guaranteed to run in all markdown preview software. So use with caution.


## Links
You can link to anything, even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page "and add a tooltip").

If you have many things to [link][1] to, or need to link to them [multiple][2] times, it's probably better to keep a [reference list][3]:

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "you can"
[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_(mathematics) "also add"
[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliographic_index "tooltips"

## Emojis
Some Markdown applications allow you to insert emoji by typing emoji shortcodes. These begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji. E.g.
>Gone camping! â›º `:tent:`
>Be back soon. ðŸ™„ `:roll_eyes:`
>That is so funny! ðŸ˜‚ `:joy`

Or you can simply copy an emoji from a source like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and paste it into your document.

# Structure
## Headers
You can structure your texts in the following way:
```
# Title (H1)
## Subtitle (H2)
### Another deeper title (H3)
```
You can use H1 `#` all the way up to H6 `######` six for different title sizes.

### H3 Header

AAAaaa

#### H4 Sub-header

BBBbbb

##### H5 Sub-header

CCCccc

###### H6 subheader

DDDddd

## Lists
Bullet list:
* Start a line with an asterisk
* Food
  * Fruits
    * Oranges
    * Apples
 * indent
	 * indent 2

Numbered list:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Check list:
- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media

## Separator
A horizontal line looks like this:

---
This is text.

## Footnotes
There is no native way to do footnotes in markdown, because markdown sheets doesn't have a concept of page size<sup>1</sup>. But you can kind of fake it using superscript and subscripts and keeping footnotes relative<sup>2</sup> to the current section. You can also link<sup><a href="#note3" id="note3ref">3</a></sup> to a footnote anywhere in the sheet.

<sub>1. so there is no foot to note, per say.</sub>
<sub>2. this does mean you have to track them manually though.</sub>
<sub><a id="note3" href="#note3ref">3</a>. but this reduces readability of the raw markdown code</sub>

## Images
If you want to insert images, this is how you do it:

![The first Wikipedia logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Wiki_logo_Nupedia.jpg)

To link to locally hosted images, put it in a folder in the same directory as the markdown file and type `![image name](./folder%20name/image%20name.png)`

# Tables
| Default aligned | Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| --------------- | :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| First body part | Second cell  |   Third cell   |   fourth cell |
| Second line     | foo          |   **strong**   |           paz |
| Third line      | bar          |    *italic*    |           boo |

# Code
If you have inline code blocks, you can wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.

If you've got a longer block of code, you can fence it with ```:

```
if (isNeat){
  return true
}
```
and specific syntax highlighting can be specified with the code language name after the graves (e.g. \`\`\`json`)
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

## Formulas
You can use $\LaTeX$ to typeset formulas with `$`. A formula can be displayed inline, e.g. $e=mc^2$, or as a block with `$$`:
$$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$

and even more complicated things like this:
$$
\begin{aligned}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
but again, this reduces readability.
