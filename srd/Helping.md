### Help

Any other character may _offer their aid_ to you while you are performing a [[Checks|Check]] or a [[Tasks|Task]], or any other [[KISSing|KISSable]] roll, so long as they do so before any dice are rolled, _aren't currently preoccupied_, and roleplay appropriately:

-   **If you accept their help, then *you gain access to their Kismet, Insights, and Specialties to use on the roll*, or they may perform a Stunt for you.**
-   **But they are tied to the consequences of their actions**, for good or ill.

You can only accept help from one character, so discuss it with them and choose wisely if you receive offers of help from multiple sources. The only exception to this is for [[Checks#Group Checks|Group checks]], where everyone involved in the roll can help one another.

>#nb
>Always discuss what you're willing to let the person you're offering help to use from your sheet to KISS dice with before offering help. This is part of the collaborative process of helping, but you can disallow them from using certain specialties, or your Ego,  for example if you're saving them for something special.

#que [[Lots]] spent on helping KISSes for [[Tasks]] convert into the *helper's* *[[Earning Experience|exp]]* tracker for the same job, not into yours.
