### The Helping Die

Any character may _offer their aid_ to a [[Player Characters|PC]] while they are performing a [[Checks|Check]] or a [[Tasks|Task]], so long as they do so before any dice are rolled, _aren't currently preoccupied_, and roleplay appropriately:

-   **If a player accepts your help, then pass them one of your dice for them to roll separately**, this die shares your ability [[Rank|rank]] _if you're the only helper_.
-   **But you are tied to the consequences of their actions**, for good or ill.

Alternatively, you may roll the  helping die yourself. But either way, this is a neat way to _tell whether you actually helped_, which can be good grist for roleplaying after the roll.

#imp The helping die cannot be [[Tasks#Optional Step Fate's Offering|offered for sacrifice]] on Tasks.

#### Multiple Helpers

If there are multiple helpers then let your [[Peers]] decide what the appropriate rank should be for the helping die, based on the _approximate number_ of helpers, as follows:

| â„– of Helpers | Die Rank |
| :----------: | :------: |
|      One     |     6    |
|      Two     |     5    |
|     A Few    |     4    |
|    Several   |     3    |
|    Dozens    |     2    |
|   Hundreds   |     1    |

##### Quality over quantity?

If you feel that the _quality of help_ is more important than the quantity of helpers then **only use the rank of the _best helper_ instead**.
