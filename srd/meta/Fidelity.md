## Fidelity

**Fidelity is a gauge that _slowly ticks up to four_, at which point you can spend it.**

Characters do not normally start with any Fidelity. Since Fidelity changes so infrequently, it is best to represent it by filling in the diamonds (◇ → ◆), clockwise, on your [character sheet](#charsheet), and erasing them all once you spend it (ie. ◆◆◆◆ → ◇◇◇◇).

> Fidelity represents a measure of your long-term success at establishing and upholding _your truth_ — your version of reality — whatever that may be, and for whatever good or ill that it may bring to others. Fidelity is the _quintessence of kismet;_ the stuff that lets you reach [[Tier#Mythic Tier|mythic]] levels of excellence.

### Spending Fidelity

Once your Fidelity gauge is full, it may be **spent at any dramatically appropriate time to _permanently advance_ the rank of one of your abilities** _by one step_ (ie. 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1).

#que This best done right at the end of [[KISSing]] — as any dice that landed within the new rank are counted as successes too — but it can be any time, really.

### Earning Fidelity

**You earn Fidelity by not faltering in your [[Creeds]]** as they are [[Challenging Principles|challenged]] by your [[Facilitator]], over the course of many sessions.

Fidelity is only gained during [[Debriefings|debriefings]] or [[Development sessions|development sessions]], usually at the end of a full [[Campaign structure|campaign arc]] (rather than between chapters).

Your FC should ask you something like, _“Which of your creeds have not faltered?”_, to which you should respond by reading them all aloud and letting your [[Peers]] press you further and point to times when they think you _may_ have faltered.

If you can defend your position and convince them, **by proving that a belief is unwavering or that your oath is unbroken, _then and only then_ do you earn the Fidelity**.

###### Changing the Gauge?

With the gauge's default size set to four, that means that one must acquire 12 Fidelity to take _one ability_ from rank 5 to rank 2, which assuming you earn about 1 Fidelity every 10-15 sessions would take at least 150 sessions! This sounds like a lot, _and it is_, but this slow kind of character progression forms a 'supercycle' that encapsulates all the other progression cycles in [[Agora]].

Shortening (or lengthening?) the Fidelity gauge will drastically change your long-term experience with the game, so this _must absolutely be discussed_ with your [[Peers]] if you're considering it.
