## Lots

**You can have _up to eight_ Lots at a time**.

Every character starts with 1d6 Lots, or they may _take the average_ and start with 3 Lots. Lots can be represented on your [character sheet](#charsheet) by filling in or erasing the diamonds (◇ ↔ ◆), or by using glass beads, the faces of an eight-sided die, or some other kind of token.

> #nb
> Lots represent the smallest parcel of fate that a player can use to manipulate their character's destiny. You can think of them as _tiny cosmic favors_ that you can trade to influence the dice, like cashing in a bit of karma.

### Spending Lots

-   **Spending a Lot on a [[Tasks|Task]] counts as a [[KISSing|KISS]]**, letting you re-roll a die of your choice _with no questions asked_.

-   In an [[Opposed Tasks#Asymmetrical Opposition|asymmetrically opposed Task roll]], you can also **spend Lots to count 'arbitrary difficulty factors'**, making success harder for your opponent.

-   Lastly, you can **convert Lots into [[Jobs#Earning Experience|experience points]]** for any [[Jobs|jobs]] of your choice, _with a 1:1 ratio_, during downtime or between sessions, or if your are ever about to exceed the eight Lots maximum.

### Earning Lots

There are four ways to earn Lots back during play:

-   **When one of your [[Goals|goals]] has notably advanced** either though a purely narrative interaction, or _codified within the results of a roll_. (This also includes _finishing_ a goal).
-   **Representing your character's [[Circumstances|circumstances]] well**. Typically, awarded by your [[Peers]] within the moment*, for _really embodying a particular trait_ and doing it justice, or using it to your advantage and getting what you wanted without the need for a roll.
-   **Limiting yourself with a [[Conditions|condition]]** and _failing_ at the resulting roll.
-   **When you get an inspired idea**, or have a _‘eureka moment’_, your [[Facilitator|FC]] may reward good lateral thinking and creative solutions (especially when it's something they didn't think of) to help to encourage you to give it go.

#ast Or you can ask at the end of the scene if you think you earned it.

#### Out-of-Session Rewards

You can also earn Lots from up to three sources in the [[Debriefings|debrief]] at the end of every [[Campaign structure#Chapters|chapter]]:

-   If your [[Principles]] drove you to play in unusual way over the last few sessions, or forced a decision to be made that you were not expecting.
    -   In other words: _If you felt adequately challenged by what your FC had laid out for you_.
-   If you can list _something that your character learned_ about the world or another character (and [[Taking notes|write it down]]).
-   If you can list something that you — _the player_ — learned about your character, the game, or the world, that you did not realize until you played them a certain way or encountered a certain scenario.
