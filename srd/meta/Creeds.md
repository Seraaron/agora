## Creeds

These are **[[Principles]] that your character believes in absolutely**, as well as any [[#Oaths|oaths]] they have sworn, doctrines they adhere to, and motivations or morals that are unwavering.

They are best written as unqualified statements of fact — even if they're not actually true — without a hint of doubt or irony in the tone, _even if that makes them sound righteous or arrogant_.

> **#eg**
>
> -   "Nothing can break our love." not, "My love won't falter unless..."
> -   "My faith will protect me!" instead of, "I hope my god is real..."

This is because part of your [[Facilitator|FC's duties]] includes [[Challenging Principles|testing and prodding]] at these convictions over the course of a campaign, **to give you opportunities to prove how ironclad their philosophies really are,** or to see how readily and steadfastly your character defends them.

### Adherence is Rewarded

During a [[Debriefings|debrief]] or a [[Development sessions|development session]] between [[arcs]], you should read aloud and discuss with your [[Peers]] which ones you feel are _still intact_.

**For each one that is still standing, *unchanged*, you earn a point of [[Fidelity]]**.

> #unfinished example of creed / fidelity discussion

###### Hold your horses!

A side-effect of the process of [[Challenging Principles|challenging Principles]] means that if there is something that you think your character _really does_ believe in without question, _and you don't want it to be questioned_, then consider adding it to your [[Circumstances|background traits]] or adding it as a [[Specialties|specialty]] instead of a creed.

#imp **By writing a creed, you are making a target for your FC.**

You can always change a specialty or a background into a creed at a later date, but you can't so easily change a creed _without playing the game_.

Similarly though, try to avoid offering any advice to your FC on how your creeds could be challenged. This is part of the fun of the game, for both of you — since if your beliefs hold true, _you will be rewarded_ — though your relationship should not become antagonistic.

### Oaths

An oath is a _special kind of creed_ that is usually **sworn during play**, or in your character's backstory if you're starting the game with an oath. _An oath must be written into your creeds as an in-character quote of what was promised,_ alongside who or what your swore it to.

An oath must be followed to the letter, _or else it is broken_. If you ever break an oath then your [[Honor]] regresses by 1 step — if you're using that [[Capabilities|capability]] in your campaign — and any chance of earning [[Fidelity]] is invalidated.

#### Completing Oaths

The only _honorable_ way to remove an oath is to have it annulled by the character you swore it to, or their superior, or to _complete the conditions of the oath as you swore it_.

**If an oath is honorably completed or removed, then it counts as _valid adherence_ for the purposes of earning Fidelity.** This makes oaths very strong, but they of course come with the responsibilities of the oath too!

> #nb
> Oaths are useful for this reason **as a way to ensure that you earn Fidelity for doing something you promised to do**.
> 
> In this light, *an oath may be seen as a ‘greater [[Goals|goal]]’ that you complete over the course of many chapters*.

#### Changing Oaths

The only way to change an oath is to swear it over with a new oath that will replace it, if whoever you swore the first one to agrees. If they do not agree, then swearing over an old oath with a new one counts as breaking the previous one.
