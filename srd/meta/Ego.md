## Ego

**You either have Ego, or you don't**, at any given time.

Every character starts the game with Ego, unless you choose to start with an extra +1d6 Lots instead. You can represent whether you currently have Ego or not by filling in or erasing the diamond (◇ ↔ ◆) on your [character sheet](#charsheet), using the faces of a coin or a playing card, or using some other kind of binary token.

> #nb
> Ego represents _quite literally_ your character's sense of self, and also the part of their psyche that believes they have control over their own reality. _Ego is a force:_ A force that makes the world conform to their vision.

### Spending Ego

-   Ego may be spent to **force a failed [[Checks|Check]] to succeed**, regardless of difficulty, _if you don't have any appropriate [[Specialties|specialty]]_.

-   **Spending Ego on a [[Tasks|Task]] counts all your 6s _twice_**.
    -   Meaning that your 6s effectively turn into double-successes.
    -   This should be done _just after_ [[KISSing]], but cannot be used on exploded dice.

-   Ego may also used to 'fuel' the most potent effects of certain [[Gambits]].

#### _Optional:_ Changing Consequences

Optionally, Ego can be spent outside of rolls to influence the narrative in larger ways: Namely, to alter or delay a [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|consequence]] (usually from a previous scene or interaction) right as it's about to rear its head!

**This doesn't _entirely prevent_ the consequence from occurring**, it either _delays the inevitable_ or just _changes it out for something equally bad_. This can dramatically change the current situation in just about any way that your [[Facilitator|FC]] and [[Peers]] agree is appropriate.

### Earning Ego

There are four main ways to earn back your Ego during play. Each option may only be used _once per session per player_ though, to avoid too much stroking of your own ego:

-   **When using a [[Habits]] presents an unforeseen dilemma**, puts you under duress, embarrasses or disturbs someone else, _or otherwise creates interesting drama_.
-   **Comedic timing.** Typically awarded by your [[Facilitator|FC]] within the moment*, for cracking an in-character joke, or acting a certain way, and _making everyone at the table laugh_ (even if the characters in the game don't find it so funny).
-   **Limiting yourself with a [[Conditions|condition]]** and _succeeding_ at the resulting roll.
-   **When you 'cash-in' a condition**, for which you have _already experienced [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]_, removing it from your sheet in exchange for Ego.

#ast Or you can ask at the end of the scene if you think you earned it.

#### _Optional:_ Taking the Lead

Optionally, **when you 'take the lead' from your FC and introduce a slower-paced _roleplaying-centered_ scene**, where you talk a lot with an [[Non-player Characters|NPC]] or a fellow [[Player Characters|Player Character]], and take the time to describe some of the set-dressing and mood and generally _make the experience of play more collaborative_, then you may also be awarded with Ego.

###### Convert excess Ego to Lots

_If you would have earned Ego_, but already have it, then take a [[Lots|Lot]] instead. (And if you're already full up on Lots too, then add a point of _[[Jobs#Earning Experience|exp]]_ to a job of your choice instead).
