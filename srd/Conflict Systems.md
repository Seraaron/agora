##### Every conflict consists of five important terms:

-   **Rounds** — are an abstract unit of time measurement that ensures that every character involved in the conflict gets to act regularly. Depending on the type of conflict, a round can last _anywhere from a few seconds to a few days_.
-   **Disposition** — is a number rolled at the beginning of a conflict that represents a combination of your moral, initiative, positioning, and willingness to be involved with the conflict in the first place. It also represents the amount of _momentum_ an opponent needs to ultimately defeat you.
-   **Momentum** — is a number that is cumulatively summed up every round by choosing your _stance_ for that round and rolling dice, and that in-turn determines which _moves_ you have access to, at any given point in the conflict.
-   **Stances** — are the ways that you can either add to your own momentum, or impede someone else's. The stance you choose can also affect which _moves_ are available to you for that round.
-   **Moves** — are unlocked at specific _momentums_ — which allows you to perform a wider array of actions, as well as more potent actions — as the conflict escalates. The same set of core moves are available to all characters, but certain other moves require special conditions to be met in order to be used.

##### A conflict progresses like this:

1.  **Everyone in the conflict rolls their disposition:**
    -   This is a job level, plus bonus dice from assets or gear, and using an appropriate ability rank. You may also KISS these dice.
    -   This is very similar to a [[Tasks|Task]] roll except we're only interesting in setting the stakes of the entire conflict and then counting the successes from the roll at this stage. There's no objectives or difficulty factors.
    -   Add these successes to a base disposition of +20 to get your final disposition. (This number, 20, will definitely need tweaking and may change according to the conflict, or character tier... not sure yet)
2.  **Begin the round:**
    -   In the first round, start with the character who has the *lowest disposition* and progress up to the highest.
    -   In all subsequent rounds, start with the character who currently has the *lowest momentum* and progress up to the highest.
3.  **On your turn:**
    -   Choose your stance for the round, and make the associated Check:
        -   _**Aggressive Stance:**_ Gain momentum for yourself.
        -   _**Counter Stance:**_ Subtract momentum from an opponent.
        -   _**Defensive Stance:**_ Defend your momentum from multiple opponents.
    -   Sum up your current momentum, after the Stance check, and choose an appropriate move to perform this round:
        -   The main moves available depend on your current stance and momentum.
        -   The more potent the move, the at more momentum needed to unlock it.
        -   You may also gain access to moves from the environment that the conflict is taking place in, the type of opponent your facing, or from your own gear and gambits.
    -   The move will tell you what to roll, and what the consequences of that roll will be.
		-   Most of these rolls work similarly to Tasks, but all the nitty-gritty details are already worked out for you, which keeps the pace of the conflict quick.
		-   Though these dice can be KISSed, like any other Task roll.
	- The most potent move, *coup de grace*, unlocks when your momentum equals or exceeds the disposition of your opponent, which lets you immediately defeat them and end the conflict if you succeed at the associated roll.
		- This should help prevent conflicts from 'slogging on' and taking ages, because the continual escalation of the momentum and the way this woks will ensure that *someone* loses eventually.
		- If this is a combat conflict, for example, then losing to this *coup de grace* means character death (unless you spend Health). 
4.  **End the round:**
    -   Resolve all the moves, apply all the damages and effects, and so on (simultaneously), ready for the next round, and summarize the activity of any onlookers or non-participants.
    -   If the conflict isn't over, go back to step 2.
    -   Repeat until a clear winner emerges, or until the conflict is either interrupted or otherwise resolved.

##### Rock, Paper, Scissors?

- Offensive gets a bonus against Defensive.
- Defensive gets a bonus against counteractive.
- Counteractive gets a bonus against Offensive.


##### Types of conflict, examples:
The specific abilities and jobs used in all the rolls and moves mentioned above will depend heavily on the type of conflict. For example:

*Mostly physical abilities:*
-   **Single Combat:** Warrior, Brawler, Mage
-   **Open Melee:** Skirmisher, Warrior, Lancer / Dragoon, Mage, Acrobat
-   **Pitched Battle:** Guard, Commander, Strategist, Archer / Gunner, Medic
- **Ship Fights??** Mariner, Pilot, etc. idk

*Mostly mental abilities:*
-   **Private Dispute:** Charmer, Cipher, Investigator, Beggar
-   **Public Debate:** Orator, Advocate, Diplomat, Interpreter, Host

It's possible I may even be able to work a magic system into these constraints, if we imagine casting spells as a mental battle with a demon that you have to defeat to release. But that may be too in depth. I'm focusing on combat for now, and if a magic system falls out of this solution then that's just a bonus.
