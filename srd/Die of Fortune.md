#### _No dice?_ → Roll the Die of Fortune!

If you're too [[Stress|stressed]], or have made enough [[#Optional Fate's Offering|offerings]] to the point where you have no dice left to roll (excluding help), or you're [[Jobs#Learning New Jobs Level 0|learning a new job]], or have zero dice left for any other reason, then you must **roll a single rank 6 _exploding die_** instead.

> **A die is said to 'explode' _if you roll a 6_.** Meaning, you count a success, and then roll another exploding die and see if you get another 6, and so on. Counting successes from all the explosions, until you don't roll another 6.

This is also sometimes called an 'open-ended' die. Here we call it the “Die of Fortune” because it _heightens the sense of drama_, and it represents _sheer luck_. The odds are slim, but it _is_ possible to get 4 or more success on a Die of Fortune roll:

| Successes |    Odds    | Chance |
| --------- | :--------: | :----: |
| 1         |   1 in 6   | 16.66% |
| 2         |   1 in 36  | 2.777% |
| 3         |  1 in 216  | 0.463% |
| 4         | 1 in ~1300 | 0.076% |

#imp **_Exploded_ dice cannot be [[KISSing|KISSed]]**, but dice that have yet to explode _can be_.

###### Other Exploding Dice

**Magic (or sufficiently-advanced technologies) are generally what makes dice explode!** The only 'naturally magic' job in the base game is the [[Mage]] job, which uses it's own [[magic subsystem]] for determining factors (and which also partly justifies _the need_ for its dice to be open-ended, because the total number of difficulty factors can exceed 10). In this case, you use the rank of the ability its tied to for all your dice, like any other job, then explode all your 6s _before KISSing_.
