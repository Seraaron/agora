### Let the dice fall where they may!

We use this phrase, or sometimes just say "let it ride" for short, to pull _triple-duty_ in [[Agora]], referring to three philosophies of play at once:

-   That you should **respect your dice as _oracles of our character's fates_**; and thus we should roll _openly and without fear_, and we shouldn't try to 'fudge' or manipulate our dice.
-   That **you shouldn't roll more than once against any one obstacle**, and _you should not roll again against that same obstacle until the initial consequences are dealt with_, or until the situation changes.
-   And that **if something is [[When to roll dice|worth rolling for]], then the potential outcomes of failure are just as important as the potential outcomes of success**.

These heuristics are useful for making tough decisions, avoiding uninteresting rolls, and generally speeding up play. But they are only heuristics. _This is just advice, not rules_. So there are some exceptions:

### Exceptions

First are [[Checks]] which, with their more limited scope, allow for more frequent reattempts than [[Tasks]]. This doesn't mean that a failed Check doesn't do anything — the [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]] of each failure should still _play out as discussed_ — but that failing a Check often doesn't preclude the opportunity to try again in the same way that a failed [[Tasks|Task]] _might_.

#### Taking it from the top...

Other times you need to **rewind the whole game back a few moments**, _void any related dice rolls_, and go back to the start of a roll, a turn, or a [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]]. Such as when:

-   **Stakes weren't set and a player rolled too soon,** without hearing the consequences. So, _to be fair to your destiny_, you should roll again and ignore whatever your dice just said would happen.

-   **A player's intent was misinterpreted** or when _the stakes were set far higher than anticipated_. This is most likely to occur when a player wasn't _clear enough_ about about their agenda, or when an FC makes too many assumptions and jumps the gun.

-   **A hard line was crossed** and a player simply wants to rewind _as far back as they need to_ — even into previous scenes if needs be — until they reach a point where they feel comfortable again.

This [[Script Change Tools#⏪ Rewind|rewinding]] process is discussed in greater detail in the '[[Script Change Tools]]' article.

> #nb
> Note that these are all mostly 'meta-exceptions'. Dire consequences may be hounding your characters all the time, in game, but only if you've understood and accepted their fate before you put them in those positions. This is all part of the 'social contract' of play.

#### Retroactive-Continuity

If you realize at some point that you should have rewound in an earlier scene or session, then mention it during a [[Wrap Up|wrap up meeting]], or between sessions to your [[Peers]], and decide what (if anything) you'd like to [ret-con](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retcon).
