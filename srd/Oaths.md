#### _Optional:_ Oaths

An Oath is a _special kind of [[Creeds|Creed]]_ that is usually **sworn during play**, or in your character's backstory if you're starting the game with an Oath. _An Oath must be written into your Creeds as an in-character quote of what was promised,_ alongside who or what your swore it to.

❗ **An Oath must be followed to the letter, _or else it is broken_.** Your character must also be using the [[Honor]] [[Capabilities|capability]] in order to swear an Oath.

If you ever break an Oath then it counts as [[Principles#Broken Creeds Regenerate Health and Ego|breaking a Creed]], but your [[Honor]] also regresses rank by one step (⬇1), and any chance of earning [[Fidelity]] from it is invalidated.

##### Completing Oaths

The only _honorable_ way to remove an Oath is to have it annulled by the character you swore it to, or their superior, or to _complete the conditions of the Oath as you swore it_.

**If an Oath is honorably completed or removed, then it immediately counts as _valid adherence_ for the purposes of earning Fidelity** (rather than needing to wait until the end of a [[Campaign Arcs|campaign arc]]). _This makes Oaths very strong_, but they of course come with the responsibilities of the Oath too!

> **Oaths are a useful way to ensure that you earn Fidelity for doing something you promised to do**.

> In this sense, _an Oath may be seen as a kind of “Greater Goal” that you complete over the course of an [[Campaign Arcs|arc]], or several arcs_.

##### Changing Oaths

The only way to change an Oath is to **swear it over with a new Oath** that will replace it, *and only if whoever you swore the first one to agrees*. If they do not agree, then swearing over an old Oath with a new one counts as breaking the previous one.
