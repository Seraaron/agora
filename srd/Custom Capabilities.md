### Custom Capabilities

It's possible to make up your own capabilities too #unfinished

#### Questionnaire Formula

Generally a capability should start at rank 6. Then ask six questions in _two sets of three_, where each set advances or regresses the capability score respectively:

- One question about current ability ranks.
- One question about current personality or opinion.
- One question about backstory or previous play experiences.

Avoid questions from one set just being the opposite of a question from the other. You want it to be theoretically possible to answer 'yes' to all the questions, going up to rank 3 and then back down to rank 6 by the end. Don't write questions that let the player 'double-dip'. That is, avoid situations where an answer to one question necessitates a similar answer to another question.

[[Honor]] is an example of a different way of thinking about a capability, but this is a relatively unique case where it's _easier to lose than it is to gain_, and it isn't based on any of your core abilities. Honor has less mechanical uses than the other capabilities too, and acts more as a social measuring stick that produces roleplaying incentives.

[[Links]] is another example of a different kind of capability, where we use it to produce a very specific game-play effect. This makes it more-akin to it's own subsystem than any other capability, but it should inspire you as to the _versatility_ of capabilities.

‚ùì [[Wealth]] may also be considered a capability, or sorts, but it's _very_ different from how we've presented capabilities thus far. Wealth is more like a job that derives it's rank from the economy.
