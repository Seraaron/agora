#### Size

Size is a special [[Circumstances#Background Traits|background trait]] because it's unlikely to ever meaningfully change during play once you're an adult, and because it has a small mechanical effect. Typically determined by your [[Ancestries List|ancestry]], diet, and [[Age|age]]. Size represents an _approximate combination_ of your physical dimensions and mass:

|    | Playable Adult Sizes | _Approx. Height_       | _Approx. Weight_              |
| -: | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1. | **Small:**           | _~3-5 ft (90-150 cm)_  | _Less than a quintal_         |
| 2. | **Modest:**          | _~5-6 ft (150-180 cm)_ | _~90-250 lbs (40-110 kg)_     |
| 3. | **Ample:**           | _~6-7 ft (180-210 cm)_ | _~250-2200 lbs (110-1000 kg)_ |
| 4. | **Large:**           | _~7-9 ft (210-275 cm)_ | _More than a tonne_           |

❓ Most adult [[Ancestries List#Humans|humans]] are considered 'Modest' under these definitions.

❗ It is not possible to play as 'smaller than small' or 'larger than large' characters without your [[Facilitator|FC's]] permission, as these may be simply impractical.

##### Size _Does_ Matter (sometimes)

When there is a difference in sizes between you and another character — and your [[Facilitator|FC]] determines that this difference should be _mechanically represented_ during a roll — then either a bonus die or a difficulty factor may be added, depending on the context of the action.

> ### Eg.
>
> A larger character attempting to wrestle with a smaller character may be given a bonus die, but if the opponent is _significantly_ smaller than the larger one then they may be given a penalty instead.

❗ Size also affects your [[Carry Weight]] limit, if you're using those rules.
