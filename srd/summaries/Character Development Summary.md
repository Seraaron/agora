#### _Character Development Summary:_

Once you have [[Character Assembly|made characters]] and begun playing the game properly, you may begin to wonder how to increase certain stats on your sheet. **So here's a list of all the methods available to you to add and remove stuff from your character as they change and grow:**

- Earn [[Lots]] and [[Ego]] by engaging with your [[Principles]], pushing your [[agenda]],  and more generally by mastering the mechanics and roleplaying well.
- Earn [[Fidelity]] from your [[Creeds]] to eventually increase ability [[Rank|ranks]].
- Regain [[Health]] by changing your mind, and breaking an [[Oaths|Oath]] or abandoning a belief.
- Rederive your [[Capabilities|capabilities]] by going through the questions again and seeing if any of your answers have changed, or swap out for new capabilities if your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|tone or theme]] has changed.
- Gain '[[Earning Experience|exp]]' and level up your [[Jobs]] by performing Tasks with that Job, or by earning an excess of [[Lots]] or creating practice scenes during [[Downtime and Travel*|downtime]], or simply as a generic reward from your [[Facilitator|FC]].
- Earn new specialties or gambits as rewards from your [[Facilitator|FC]] for completing a [[Goals|Goal]] or keeping a [[Habits|Habit]] for a long time, or as a result of a broken [[Creeds|Creed]].
- Change your [[VINPCs|Kith or Kin]], if you feel they are no longer important to the game (or if other characters have shown up that are more important), by asking your [[Peers]] if it's okay to do so at this time — in case any of them had plans for that VINPC.
- Acquire [[Assets and Gear|assets]] from advancing in your society, gaining prestige and influence, accomplishing great deeds, or [[Building|building]] them yourself.
- Pick up new [[Gear List|bits of gear]] by spending money or resources, as gifts from [[Non-player Characters*|NPCs]], or by looting and plundering the people or locations you visit.
- Gain, change, or remove any of your features — circumstances / traits, specialties, conditions, assets, or gambits — with a [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|vote]], conducted by your [[Peers]].
- Get new conditions from [[Wounds and Scars|scars]] after [[Health|getting injured]] and [[Wounds and Scars#Convalescence|healing]].

Whenever any of these things happen, it's a good idea to notify your [[Peers]] if they're not already involved in the conversation, so that you can all help to keep each other accountable.
