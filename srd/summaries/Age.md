#### Age

Age is a special [[Circumstances#Foreground Traits|foreground trait]] because age can change over extended periods of time, and because it has a small mechanical effect. Typically determined by how long you've been alive, age represents the stage of adulthood you're currently at for your species.

|     | Playable Adult Ages | Common Jobs | _Approx. Human Equivalent_ |
| ---:| ------------------- |:----------:|-------------------------- |
|  1. | **Young:**          |     2      | _~18-25 yrs_               |
|  2. | **Seasoned:**       |     3      | _~25-40 yrs_               |
|  3. | **Mature:**         |     5      | _~40-60 yrs_               |
|  4. | **Old:**            |     8      | _~60-90 yrs_               |

The older your character's starting age, the more [[D66 Jobs|common jobs]] you get to raise by 1. You must roll (or choose) these jobs during [[Character Assembly]].

❗ It is not possible to play as child or an extremely elderly character without your [[Peers|Peer's]] permission, as they are **capped at only one [[Health]]** — and they are likely to be more difficult to roleplay respectfully, or may not suit your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|tone]].
