#### _Character Assembly Summary:_

1. **Concept & Tier:**
	- A [[Character Assembly#1 Concept Concept Concept|concept]] is a sentence, reference, or image that encapsulates your idea for the character.
	- [[Tier]] sets the approximate power level of your character for the whole campaign. Higher tiers give you better ability ranks and grant you more _'caps'_ to spend in **step 4**.
2. **Choose Archetypes:** (one of each)
	1. **[[Ancestries List|Ancestry]]** — Grants you an inherent gambit and a bonus condition, usually.
	2. **[[Cultures List|Culture]]** — Grants you a few bonus job levels, a couple of specialties, and a bonus to wealth or community assets.
	3. **[[Professions List|Profession]]** — Grants the majority of your job levels, a few specialties, assets or gear, your base wealth, and a gambit.
    - _Remember:_ All jobs start at level 1.
3. **Roll on Random Tables:**
	- _Roll on any archetype tables, if you haven't already._
	- Roll on the [[D66 Jobs]] table, a number of times according to your [[Age|age]], and raise those jobs by +1 level.
	- Roll on the [[D666 Conditions]] table, once or twice.
	- _Or choose from the tables, if you'd prefer not to roll._
4. **Spend your _Character Assembly Points:_**
	- Use these points to buy assets and gear, extra job levels or specialties, assets, gear, conditions, and new gambits (or advance the level of your current gambits).
5. **Finishing Touches:**
	1. Finalize your [[Rank|ability ranks]], and choose any [[Capabilities|capabilities]] too.
	2. _Flesh out your [[Circumstances|circumstances]]:_
	    - Choose your name or alias, traits or appearance, size and age, and anything else you feel is important to list at the top of your character sheet.
	    - Answer any other [[Bonding and Backstory Questions*]] you like, and [[Taking notes|take a note]] of your answers.
	5. Make up any [[VINPCs]] you want to see regularly in the campaign.
	6. Write your [[Principles|principles]].
6. **Make a Backup:** Scan or save your work, keep it in cloud storage, or an external hard-drive, take a photo on your phone, or print an extra copy, etc.
