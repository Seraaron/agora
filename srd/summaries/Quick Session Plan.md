### *Quick Session Plan:*

**Use the following steps to remind you what to prioritize any time you need to plan a session or improvise:**

1.  **Look at each player's [[Principles]] and [[Circumstances]]:**
    -   How can you [[Challenging Principles|challenge them]]?
		-   Which [[Goals|goals]] are they most likely to pursue this session?
		-   Which [[Habits|habits]] are going to create the most drama?
		-   Which [[Creeds|creeds]] are on the verge on being broken?
    -   What obstacles or antagonists will stand between them when they try to impose their [[Agenda|agendas]] on the world?
2.  **Look at each player's [[VINPCs|Kith & Kin]]:**
    -   Which ones currently have their favor and which ones don't?
		-   Why is that, or why don't they?
		-   What could the players do to get their favor back?
    -   What happened most recently with these characters? 
		-   What does each [[VINPCs|VINPC]] want next, and why?
		-   What are their [[Agenda|agendas]]?
3.  **Play the world:**
    -   What are some other [[Non-player Characters|NPCs]] up to, and what are their [[Agenda|agendas]]?
    -   How does the [[Factions and Organizations|political or factional landscape]] respond to what's happened in previous sessions?
		-   Is anyone pleased or angry by the latest events?
		-   Does it open new opportunities, and who can exploit them?
    -   Are there any new [[Worldbuilding|worldbuilding]] concepts, pieces of lore, or characters you'd like to introduce this session?
		-   What are some fun ways you can you introduce these things without just expositing them?
4.  **Look at each player's [[Stress|stresses]] and [[Conditions|conditions]]:**
    -   Which ones will probably need [[Stress#Remedies for Stress|remedying]] soon? Is there time for them to rest and relax this session, or are events moving too quickly?
    -   Do you want to present a scene that could give them [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]?
    -   When is the next most-likely opportunity for some [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]]?
