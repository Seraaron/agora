#### Tasks can be broken into _3 phases:_

1. **[[Tasks#1 Set-up|The Set-up:]]**
	- Discuss  your actions and [[Agenda|agenda]], and how they  translate into objectives and [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]].
	- Gather [[Jobs|job dice]] and [[Assets and Gear|gear or asset dice]], add additional bonuses, and subtract any related [[Stress|stress]].
	- Determine the [[Difficulties and Consequences|difficulty factors]] acting against you.

2. **[[Tasks#2 Roll Dice|The Rolls:]]**
	- Roll the dice and count successes from the faces that land _equal to or greater than_ your job's linked ability [[Rank|rank]].
	- [[KISSing|KISS]] any dice that failed you, to re-roll them, get some [[Helping|help]] from your allies, or spend [[Ego]] to double any 6s.

3. **[[Tasks#3 Apply Outcomes|The Outcomes:]]**
	- Compare total successes to the number of difficulty factors:
		- _Pass if they equal or exceed the number of factors_.
		- _Fail if the number of successes falls short_.
	- Apply consequences, and roleplay appropriately in response.
