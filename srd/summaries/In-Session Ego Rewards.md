#### In-Session Ego Rewards:

Regain Ego _immediately_, whenever any these things occur:

- **When you limiting yourself with a [[Conditions|condition]] and take a die penalty before rolling**. Or if you 'accept your fate' and don't roll at all — in which case you may _refresh a [[Specialties|specialty]]_ too.
- **When you _cash-in_ a condition** — for which you have _already experienced [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]_ — **and remove it from your sheet in exchange for Ego**.
- **When you [[Principles#Broken Principles|break]] a [[Principles|principle]] at a dramatically appropriate time.** You will also regain [[Health]] from doing this if it's a [[Creeds|Creed]], or you'll earn a [[Lots|Lot]] at the end of the session if you roleplayed well but ultimately retained it.

If you realize after the fact that one of these things happened, then take the Ego at the [[End-of-Session Ego Rewards|end of the session]].
