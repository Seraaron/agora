#### In-Session Ego Rewards:

Regain Ego _immediately_, whenever any these things occur:

- **When you limiting yourself with a [[Conditions|condition]] and take a −1 die penalty before rolling**.
- **When you _‘cash-in’_ a condition** — for which you have _already experienced [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]_ — **and remove it from your sheet in exchange for Ego**.
- **When you [[Principles#Broken Principles|break]] a [[Principles|principle]] at a dramatically appropriate time.**
	- You will also regain [[Health]] from doing this if it was a [[Creeds|Creed]].
	- You'll earn a [[Lots|Lot]] at the end of the session, instead, if you roleplayed well but ultimately retained it.

If you realize after the fact that one of these things happened, then take the Ego at the [[End-of-Session Ego Rewards|end of the session]].
