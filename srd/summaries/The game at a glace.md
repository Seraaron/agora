## _At a glance:_

-   **Create and play as highly-customizable and personal characters, without getting bogged down by too many small numbers!**
-   **Write and pursue your [[Principles|character motivations]] directly, and be [[Kismet|rewarded]] for your efforts both narratively and mechanically!**
-   **_Two_ pool-based resolution systems, using D6s, counting successes based on [[Rank|rank]]:**
    -   **Quick-and-dirty [[Checks]]** — _for fast-paced action!_
    -   **Deep-and-varied [[Tasks]]** — _for slower, more nuanced, scenes…_
-   **Level-up individual [[Jobs|jobs]] based on their in-game use!**
-   **Use bespoke [[Capabilities|capabilities]] and [[Gambits|gambits]] to perfectly match the style and themes of your setting, or your current adventure!**
-   **Clean and accessible design, with an easy-to-navigate _[free wiki](https://publish.obsidian.md/agora)!_**
