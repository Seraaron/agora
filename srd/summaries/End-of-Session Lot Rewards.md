#### End-of-Session Lot Rewards:

During the [[Wrap Up|wrap up meeting]] of every session, each of you should ask and answer the following questions and **take a [[Lots|Lot]] for each one that you can answer 'yes' to** and explain your reasoning for (subject to [[Peers|Peer]] approval):

- **Have any of your [[Goals]] notably advanced this session?** Either by a purely narrative interaction or _codified within the results of a roll_.
	- If the Goal was _completed_ then you may regain [[Ego]] instead.
- **Were you tempted to [[Principles#Broken Principles|break]] any of your [[Principles|principles]] today, and _if so_ how did it come up through play?** That is, did you have to make any tough decisions that you were not expecting, or were there any moments when you really struggled and demonstrated your ambivalence.
	- If the principle _was broken_ then you should have gained [[Ego]] during the session instead. If you forgot, then gain Ego now.
- **Did any of your character's [[Circumstances|circumstances]] drive play in an unusual direction this session?** This can be a reward for _really embodying a particular trait_ and doing it justice in a scene, or just representing your character well.
	- This may also be awarded by your Peers, if you can't think of a specific moment but they can.
- **Can you tell us _something new that your character learned_ about the world or another character today?** Alternatively, can you list something that you — _the player_ — learned about your character, the game, or the world, that you did not realize until you played them a certain way or encountered a certain scenario.

Each player can earn _at most_ **4 Lots per session** from these questions, even if they have multiple good answers to the same question.
