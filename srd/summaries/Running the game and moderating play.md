'Intrigue' is what happens when an actor in the story has a different agenda from one they publicly espouse

prep can only get you so far, and the amount of time you spend prepping a game is rarely (if ever) commensurate to the amount of fun your players will have each session
- (player fun is logarithmic, wheras prep time is exponential, you want to be in the hot spot where they intersect)

### social encounters

- you can talk all day in character an never get anywhere
	- and maybe that's fun
- but a system can enable and direct the rp, and mechanics can expedite play
- having 'social HP' leads to a survival mentality

the FC has three main tools they can use to press for rp
- accents - sets tone
- dilemmas - push the players buttons
- timers and turns - sets pacing

rp emerges from dilemmas in different ways
- locks: the players must rp, asking questions, to find a key to unlock the next part of the conversation
	- this is usually difficult to pull of, because the parameters are unclear
	- rp should not be treated like a trap, or a guessing game; it's a response
- bubbles: the players rp freely to create outcomes
	- better, because there is no set solution, only reactions and consequences

main rp outcomes:
- favorable, fun / epic / cool
- expected, move on
- awful, difficulty increases

this is where [[turns]] come in!

- it's somewhat of an artificial imposition, but it ensures that everyone gets a chance to speak
	- even if what they say is just agreement or no comment 
	- and speaking out of turn is rude
- helps to spotlight the players and can reduce background chatter
- we're all used to taking turns in combat. it's more nuianced in social encounters, but it can be done!
