## Capabilities

**Capabilities are optional abilities**. They function almost identically to normal abilities — in that they each have a [[Rank|rank]] which can be used to base rolls on — but their ranks are derived during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] (or during other [[Development Sessions]]) by answering a short questionnaire about some of your [[Abilities|core abilities]], your [[Circumstances|circumstances]], and your life experiences up until the point in play where the capability is derived.

A character may have _up to three_ capabilities at any given time, and they can help to define a campaign's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|core themes]] and what some common actions may be. It is _not recommended that you use all three capability slots for every campaign_ though; so have a good discussion with your [[Peers]] during your [[Development Sessions#Session Zeroes|first development session]] about which ones you want to use and why. **Make sure you understand what you're adding and _why_, before you add it.**

### Example Capabilities

[[Agora]] presents four examples of capabilities that you can use in your games — called **[[Grit]]**, **[[Honor]]**, **[[Links]]**, and **[[Vigilance]]** — which represent _more abstract character attributes_ than simply mind or body. Each has suggestions for what kinds of actions you can perform with them, and what types of campaign they're best suited for. As _each is almost a small module onto themselves_.

> #nb 
> When considering best and worst abilities, if there's a tie in ranks then the answer is always in your favor towards giving you a higher rank. That is, two tied but 'worst' ranks means that neither is the worst, whereas two tied 'best' ranks means that both are the best.

###### What does hesitation mean to you?

Failing a [[Grit]] or [[Vigilance]] check doesn't take away your agency as a player, except in the same ways that _any_ failed roll might. You still have control over how your character reacts to that failure.

> #eg
> Throw up, run away, faint, scream, laugh hysterically, burst into tears, soil yourself, beg for mercy, beg for death, or simply stand in a daze; or whatever _feels right_ in the moment.

- **A moment of hesitation is mostly an opportunity to roleplay** before the end of your [[Session Structure#Turns|turn]], though your hesitation may be counted as a [[Difficulties and Consequences#Choosing Factors|factor]] against you if must act again within the same [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]].
- **Hesitation may be given as failure condition to other appropriately life-threatening rolls too**, not just Grit or Vigilance checks.
	- For example, in [[Martial Combat|martial combat]] there are moves that can cause hesitation.

### Custom Capabilities

It's possible to make up your own capabilities too #unfinished

#### Questionnaire Formula

Generally a capability should start at rank 6. Then ask six questions in _two sets of three_, where each set advances or regresses the capability score respectively:

-   One question about current ability ranks.
-   One question about current personality or opinion.
-   One question about backstory or previous play experiences.

Avoid questions from one set just being the opposite of a question from the other. You want it to be theoretically possible to answer 'yes' to all the questions, going up to rank 3 and then back down to rank 6 by the end. And don't write questions that let the player 'double-dip'; so don't let an answer to one question necessitate a similar answer to another question.

[[#Honor]] is an example of a different way of thinking about a capability, but this is a relatively unique case where it's _easier to lose than it is to gain_, and it isn't based on any of your core abilities. Honor has less mechanical uses than the other capabilities too, and acts more as a social measuring stick that produces roleplaying incentives.

[[#Links]] is another example of a different kind of capability, where we use it to produce a very specific game-play effect. This makes it more-akin to it's own subsystem than any other capability, but it should inspire you as to the _versatility_ of capabilities.

###### Asynchronous Capabilities

Because capabilities are completely modular and customizable, it's possible for different [[Player Characters|PCs]] in the same game to each have different capabilities. Only allow this if it makes sense for your setting and campaign. _Try to be consistent in how and when you apply these rules_. You don't want to have players off in their own worlds too much. Try not to get too distracted by sub-mechanics that only a few people will care about.

---

### Changing Capabilities

It's also possible to have different sets of capabilities that change over time. This is easy enough to do during [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]] or a [[Development Sessions|development sessions]] by simply **re-deriving the capability you want, when you need it**. The interesting thing about this is that you may find your answers change over time, which can also affect your ranks.

> #eg
> If your game is about adventuring out into the weird wilds, exploring and fighting, then you might want to make use of the **Vigilance** and **Grit** capabilities to start with.
> 
> Once the adventuring is done, and you want to settle in a town, it may be more important to start using **Links** or **Honor**. Perhaps, after an [[Campaign Arcs|arc]] or two spend in town, you go out adventuring again and then switch back to Vigilance and Grit; but maybe you keep Links now too, since you've made a bit of a name for yourselves.

#que You should only re-derive your capabilities when you change them. Don't worry about changing your answers and shifting your rank as soon as something happens in game that might affect one. Just wait until it gets properly questioned again.
