## Wounds and Scars

**You get wounded when you spend [[Health]] to [[Health#Cheating Death|cheat death]]**, and you get scars once those wounds fade. _A wound temporarily recedes the rank of one of your abilities by one step (ie. 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6) until you [[Health#Healing|heal]]._

A wound can be visually signified on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] by putting a light slash through your current rank and writing the new rank in superscript (eg. $5$ → $\cancel{5} ^6$).

❗ If the chosen ability is _already at rank 6_, regressing it any further means that you are completely unable to use that ability, and you will fail all rolls with it automatically. Put an X mark through the rank to signify this (ie. $6$ → $\cancel{\bcancel{6}}$)

### Types of Wounds

When you put a slash through your current ability rank, you should also give a name to the trauma, and [[Taking notes|write a note]] about it somewhere on your character sheet or in your journal. This name should reflect the kind of harm that was done to you:

> ### Eg.
>
> - **Mental wounds** could mean psychological trauma or memory loss (Res), or damage to your eyes or ears or other senses (Wit), reduced cognition (App / Wit), or some other kind of brain damage (Any), or simply that part of your face or body is disfigured which affects your confidence (App).
>
> - **Physical wounds** might mean broken bones (Fin), muscle damage (Swi), a bad infection or disease, or poisoning (End), organ rupture (End), or a lost limb (Fin / Swi), or something equally crippling (Any).

❓ [[Capabilities]] aren't typically able to be wounded, though some have unique [[Stress|stresses]] associated with them.

### Convalescence

**As you heal, your wound is eventually replaced with a scar**, which then works exactly like [[Conditions#Applying Conditions|any other condition]]. This process is called 'convalescence' — _the period of healing_. The exact point at which the conversion from wound to scar happens is decided by your [[Peers]], but it's usually during [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]] or [[Development Sessions|development sessions]].

![[Medical Treatment]]

❗ _Sometimes_ convalescence can happen at the same time as the [[Health#Healing|recovery of Health]], but it generally doesn't: Meaning that _it's possible to still carry a wound while at full Health_.

#### Count Your Lucky Scars

Scars have names, like any [[Conditions|condition]], and those names are usually related to the wounds they came from. Indeed, very often, the name of the scar remains largely unchanged from from the name of the original wound. Other times, the name of the scar can be related to the treatment of the wound, or a side effect of treatment, or just something that stays with you long after the visible signs disappear.

> ### Eg.
>
> **The name of a scar is ultimately up to you, but your [[Peers]] may also offer suggestions, such as:**
>
> - Amputated Left Arm (Fin) → Prosthetic Left Arm
> - Betrayed (App) → Untrusting
> - Stared into the Void (Res) → Stared into the Void
> - Disemboweled (End) → Large Abdominal Scar
> - Facial Burns (App) → Disfigured
> - Cracked Skull (Wit) → Metal-Plate in Skull
> - Broken Legs (Fin) → Depressed

❗ Scarring can affect you both physically and psychologically: **Once a wound has become a scar the way that it affects you afterwards is up to you,** _like any other condition_.

##### Cosmetic Scars

Eventually, even scars heal. Either because you've finally learned to cope with the adverse effects; you feel like you're 'back to normal'; you've run out of good stories to tell; or because it's just not a prominent aspect of your character anymore; or because other scars have now superseded it.

Use the '[[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]' system once you feel like you're at this point, and then either change the scar to become a cosmetic [[Circumstances|circumstance]], or remove it entirely.
