### Lancer / Dragoon ([[Finesse|Fin]])

#militant #animal #vehicle 

Fighting with melee or short-ranged weapon while mounted on the back of a steed (ie. an animal that has been trained to not get spooked by combat) or from a small vehicle, like a chariot or car, often while lightly armored, or from a standing mech.

May also include fighting on the back of a well-trained aerial mount, if that’s appropriate for your setting; or fighting from the air by yourself if you are somehow capable of great leaps, gliding, or personal flight, using [[Swiftness]].

#imp **Requires:** [[Rider]] *and* [[Warrior]] both level 2, a steed, and a weapon.

_**Suggested Specialties:** [animals (steed) / vehicle (rideable)], [armor / weapons], Competition, [martial arts], Tactics…_
