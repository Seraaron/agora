### Creeds

These are **the [[Principles|principles]] that your character believes in absolutely**, as well as any [[Oaths]] they have sworn, doctrines they adhere to, and motivations or morals that are unwavering.

They are best written as unqualified statements of fact — even if they're not actually true — without a hint of doubt or irony in the tone, _even if that makes them sound righteous or arrogant!_

> ### Eg.
>
> - "Nothing can break our love." **not**, "My love won't falter unless..."
> - "My faith will protect me!" **instead of**, "I hope my god is real..."

This is because part of your [[Facilitator|FC's]] duties includes [[Challenging Principles|testing and prodding]] at these convictions over the course of a campaign, **to give you opportunities to prove how ironclad your beliefs really are,** or to see how readily and steadfastly your character defends them.

#### A Changed Mind is a Healed Heart...

When you are **faced with a moral dilemma** — when a Creed is demanding one reaction from you, but other motivations or circumstances are drawing you in other direction — if a Creed is broken in that moment, then you will **immediately regain a point of [[Health]]**. That is, you _only heal when you change your mind_.

You will also gain a point of [[Ego]] for [[Principles#Broken Principles|breaking a principle]]. If your Health &or Ego are already filled, then they will convert to [[Lots]] instead.

❓ When you break a Creed you should also write a new one to replace it. But if that's not appropriate, or if you can't think of anything, then you can just remove it and leave it open for [[Principles#Discovering Principles|discovery]].

#### ...but Adherence is Rewarded

Once per [[Campaign Arcs|arc]], **so long as one of your Creeds is still standing, _unchanged_, you earn a point of [[Fidelity]]**.

❓ This is usually done during a [[Development Sessions|development session]] between [[Campaign Arcs|arcs]]. You should read aloud and discuss with your [[Peers]] which ones you feel are _still intact_. Ask yourself in this moment, "do I still _really_ believe this?", and try to be honest.

You can also take this opportunity to examine the Creeds that you did break during the arc, discuss _why_, and how it made you feel. Although [[Fidelity]] is a potent long-term reward, remember that without [[Health]] your character will eventually die.

###### Hold Your Horses!

A side-effect of this process of [[Challenging Principles|challenging principles]] means that if there is something that you think your character _really does_ believe in without question, _and you don't want it to be questioned_, then consider adding it to your [[Circumstances|circumstances]] or making it a [[Specialties|specialty]] instead.

❗ That is, **by writing a Creed you are painting a target on your characters sheet for your [[Facilitator]] to take aim at.** This is part of the fun of the game, for both of you — since if your beliefs hold true, _you will be rewarded_ — **though your relationship should not become antagonistic**.

❓ You can always promote a circumstance into a Creed at a later date, but _you can't so easily change a Creed without playing the game_.
