## Tasks

**Tasks are more complicated than [[Checks]].** They are a measure of your training and expertise, and can be used to achieve multiple things at a time, or many things sequentially: After some initial discussion and rolling dice, you then get the opportunity to show off and re-roll some dice using a special mechanic called '[[KISSing]]'.

_Tasks use a pool of d6s, gathered mainly from a [[Jobs|Job's level]], and must reach a difficulty threshold in successes to achieve what you want._

> ##### Tasks can be broken into _three phases:_
>
> 1.  **[[#1 Set-up|Set-up:]]**
>
>     -   Discuss  your actions and [[Agenda|agenda]], and how they  translate into objectives and consequences.
>     -   Gather [[Jobs|job dice]], use [[Assets and Gear|assets]], minus [[Stress|stress]], [[Fate's Offering|make offerings]], and get [[Helping|help]].
>     -   Determine the [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|difficulty factors]] acting against you.
> 2.  **[[#2 Roll Dice|Roll Dice:]]**
>
>     -   Roll the dice and count successes on dice that land _equal to or greater than_ your job's ability [[Rank|rank]].
>     -   [[KISSing|KISS]] any dice that failed you, to re-roll them.
> 3.  **[[#3 Apply Outcomes|Apply Outcomes:]]**
>
>     -   Compare total successes to the number of difficulty factors:
>         -   _Pass if they equal or exceed the number of factors_.
>         -   _Fail if the number of successes falls short_.
>     -   Apply consequences, and roleplay appropriately in response.

### 1. Set-up

This is the discussion phase, where you must [[Agenda|state your agenda]] and describe how and why you want to achieve it in game. Then **talk with your your [[Peers]]** about how that agenda translates into an 'objective' and _what the consequences will be_, which job to use and how many dice you'll be rolling, the difficulty of the Task, and any sacrifices you want to make.

> ##### Discussing Objectives and Consequences:
>
> **Your objectives are a distillation of your agenda into a single sentence**. Typically, **this will consist of a main objective and _up to three side_ objectives** — which may or may not be contingent upon one another* — but the more you try to do in a single roll the harder it will get to succeed (see below).
>
> **Your FC should always make it clear to you — _the player_ — what the consequences of the roll will be**, if they've not already been implied. This is what will happen as a result of your actions, a glimpse of your potential future, _regardless of success or failure_.
>
> #ie
> _Whenever you attempt to impose your agenda, the world reacts;_ and though those reactions aren't entirely in your control — and may not even be _known_ to your character — you deserve to know what they're likely to be, so you can make an informed decision about how to proceed.

#ast When a player's agenda is split up into multiple objectives, Facilitators should be careful not to 'double-dip' by counting extra difficulty factors related to those side objectives: **Since each objective _is itself_ a factor.**

#imp There is always room to adjust the consequences before you roll dice: If you shift your objective slightly, or change your description to use a different job, the consequences may alter in kind.

**See also:** [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences]]

#### Gather Job dice and Bonuses

**You may suggest which [[Jobs|job]] you think is most appropriate for you to roll** _but your Peers may disagree with you and suggest another Job instead_, based on their own interpretation of what you've described.

> #nb
> If your Peers _are_ disagreeing with you (or each other) about the job then try to break it down:
>
> -   **Discuss which [[Abilities|ability]] is being used first-and-foremost** (as every job takes its rank from the ability it's tied to).
> -   Then _remind yourselves of the action and the intent_, and that should lead you to agree on which job to use.
>
> If there's still a disagreement, then the [[Facilitator]] has the final say.

**Gather dice equal to the 'level' of the chosen job**, and search for bonus dice from [[#Getting Help|help]], by using an [[Assets and Gear|asset]], or from other sources.

#que _Don't worry about your [[Specialties|specialties]] at this stage_, remember, they get used when [[KISSing]].

##### Subtracting Stress

If you are currently [[Stress|stressed]] in the ability that the job you're rolling is tied to, then subtract that many dice from your pool before rolling.

##### Getting Help

If you were [[Helping|offered help]], the helping die typically uses the rank of the helper's ability, which may differ from your own, and so should be _rolled separately_ (or rolled with a different colored die).

#imp Help dice are also unaffected by stress, but cannot be [[Fate's Offering|offered for sacrifice]].

#### Set the Difficulty Factors

**Factors represent the obstacles that your character must overcome to accomplish their objectives, and therefore the number of successes needed to get what you want**. _Should you roll fewer successes than there are factors then you will fail the Task_.

To begin with, **every Task starts with a number of factors equal to the number of objectives**. Generally, _this can be no more than four things_ before the Task should be broken up into multiple rolls. This is because the game usually progresses in [[Session Structure#Turns|turns]], and there's only so much you can accomplish at one time.

> #eg
>
> 1.  _"Sneak past the sleeping monster undetected"_ is one objective, and so 1 starting factor.
> 2.  _"Sneak past the sleeping monster and avoid the traps"_ is two objectives, so 2 starting factors.
> 3.  _"Sneak past the sleeping monster, avoiding any traps, and looting the chalice from its hoard"_ is three objectives, and so 3 starting factors.
> 4.  _"Sneak past the monster, avoid traps, steal the chalice, and lock the door on the way out"_ is four objectives, and so 4 starting factors.
>
> All four of these things can be accomplished with a single roll of the [[Thief]] job, for example. Breaking it up into multiple rolls each with fewer factors would be definitely be easier; but it would also take more [[turns]], and the world may react to your actions in the meantime.

By assessing the context of the current situation, drawing on the discussion around your agenda and objectives, and taking the methods you're using to achieve it into consideration, **your FC may declare _up to four_ relative difficulty factors**.

There are generally two lists that the FC can [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|draw factors from]] for every Task — [[Generic Difficulty Factor Examples|a generic list]], and [[Jobs List|a job-specific list]].

The FC should focus on _only the most important factors for the agenda_, **not just selecting any and all that apply**:

![[Generic Difficulty Factor Examples]]

#que Alternatively, if you're using a [[Subsystems Index|special subsystem]] or fighting a [[monster]], then the number of factors may be pre-established; closer to a _target number_ chosen based on the action and the agenda.

###### Table Talk

When you first start playing this game, the set-up phase can take a few minutes each time you go through it. Don't despair though, because _this is still a valid part of the game_. Which is to say, you don't stop playing just because you're now talking out-of-game with your friends; _so long as you're still talking about the game_.

It's usually worth the time spent talking, because a Task can often accomplish a lot more in those minutes than _hours of play_ might do otherwise. And as you get used to the game and settle into your characters, the process and pacing should speed up eventually.

> #nb
> These discussions are stictly _non-linear_, meaning that the order that you go through them may not be the same for every Task. Some times you may find you need to return to some parts multiple times as the conversation flows, other times you may find you skip over the parts that are implicit.
>
> There's a back-and-forth to this process, and it's _conversational in nature_, not a one-sided decree

### 2. Roll Dice

> #nb
> **Roll all your remaining dice and _count successes_ for each face that lands on a number _equal to or greater than_ your rank.**

#### KISS dice to re-roll them

**If the initial roll represents your raw talent or natural intuitions, then your 'Kismet, Insight, Stunts, and Specialties' represent techniques and skills _that you only use if you need to_**, or the spending of cosmic favors for another shot at success.

> #nb
> **[[KISSing]] has it's own article of advice for players to browse** — which makes up the majority of the rolling phase — but here's the short version:
>
> -   Mechanically, **each KISS lets you re-roll a die and count more successes** to help you overcome the factors that stand against you.
> -   Narratively, _each KISS adds to the drama by raising the stakes, revealing new information, or letting you show off_.
>
> Remember to ‘keep it short and sweet’ too!

#imp **You must accept the results once the dice have been KISSed**, even if they're no better (or worse) than the initial roll.

![[Die of Fortune]]

### 3. Apply Outcomes

Once the rolling is finished and you have counted up all your successes you should have a pretty good idea of what's coming:

-   **If you met or exceeded the target number of factors with successes, then you complete Task** and fulfill your objectives.
-   **If you have fewer successes than the number of factors, then you fail the Task** and none of your objectives are fulfilled (except those that you [[Fate's Offering|made offerings]] for, to guarantee).

> #nb
> Typically, once you've rolled for a Task, either you or your FC can _describe what the outcome looks like_. If you failed by a small margin, then you may describe which factors were overcome and which ones ultimately foiled you, but this is mostly for narrative effect — *the full consequences of failure will still be applied.*

Then your [[turn]] concludes, and _the consequences of your actions may haunt you for many more turns to come_, regardless of success or failure, and the game continues on as we '[[Let the dice rest|let the dice rest]]'.

#### Learning from your mistakes

_When you fail a Task,_ **you may add one experience point to the job you just used**, filling in the next 'exp diamond' on your character sheet under that job's name (ie.  ◇ -> ◆).
