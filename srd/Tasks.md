## Tasks

**Tasks are more complicated than [[Checks]].** They are a measure of your training and expertise, and can be used to achieve multiple things at a time, or many things sequentially.

![[Task Summary]]

### 1. Set-up

This is the discussion phase, where you must [[Agenda|state your agenda]] and describe how and why you want to achieve it in game. Then **talk with your your [[Peers]]** about how that agenda translates into 'objectives' and _what the consequences of your actions will be_, as well as which job to use and how many dice you'll be rolling, and the difficulty of the Task.

#### Discuss Objectives and Consequences

**Your objectives are a distillation of your agenda into a single sentence**. Typically, **this will consist of a 'main objective' and _up to three_ 'side objectives'** — which must be contingent upon one another — but the more you try to do in a single Task the harder the roll will get (see [[#Set the Difficulty Factors|below]]).

**Your FC should always make it clear to you what the consequences of the roll will be**, if they've not already been implied. This is a hint as to what will happen as a result of your actions — a glimpse of your potential future, _regardless of success or failure_ — shared between players.

> ### Ie.
>
> _Whenever you attempt to impose your agenda, the world reacts._ Though those reactions aren't entirely in your control — and may not even be _known_ to your character — you deserve to know what they're likely to be, so you can make an informed decision about how to proceed.

❗ There is always room to adjust the consequences before you roll dice: If you shift your objective slightly, or change your description to use a different job, the consequences may alter in kind.

#### Gather your Job's Level in Dice + Bonuses

**You may suggest which [[Jobs|job]] you think is most appropriate for you to roll** _but your Peers may disagree with you and suggest another Job instead_, based on their own interpretation of what you've described.

> ### Nb.
>
> If your Peers _are_ disagreeing with you (or each other) about the job then try to break it down:
>
> - **Discuss which [[Abilities|ability]] is being used first-and-foremost** (as every job takes its rank from the ability it's linked to).
> - Then _remind yourselves of the action and the intent_, and that should lead you to agree on which job to use.
>
> If there's still a disagreement, then your [[Facilitator]] has the final say.

**Gather dice equal to the 'level' of the chosen job**, then search for bonuses from your [[Assets and Gear|asset and gear]], or from any other advantages that the FC awards you. Though bonuses like these are generally quite rare, because most of that stuff is accounted for when you come to [[KISSing|KISS]].

##### Subtract Stress

If you are currently [[Stress|stressed]] in the ability that you're using to roll the job with, then subtract that many dice from your pool before rolling.

#### Set the Difficulty

**Factors represent the obstacles that your character must overcome to accomplish their objectives, and therefore the number of successes needed to get what you want**. _Should you roll fewer successes than there are factors then you will fail the Task_.

**Every Task starts with a number of factors equal to the number of objectives**. Generally, _this can be no more than four things_ before the Task should be broken up into multiple rolls. This is because the game usually progresses in [[Session Structure#Turns|turns]], and there's only so much you can accomplish at one time.

> ### Eg.
>
> 1. _"Sneak past the sleeping monster undetected"_ **is one objective, and so 1 starting factor.**
> 2. _"Sneak past the sleeping monster and avoid the traps"_ **is two objectives, so 2 starting factors.**
> 3. _"Sneak past the sleeping monster, avoiding any traps, and looting the chalice from its hoard"_ **is three objectives, and so 3 starting factors.**
> 4. _"Sneak past the monster, avoid traps, steal the chalice, and lock the door on the way out"_ **is four objectives, and so 4 starting factors.**
>
> All four of these things can be accomplished with a single roll of the [[Thief]] job, _for example_. Breaking it up into multiple rolls each with fewer factors would be definitely be easier — but it would also take more time, and the world may react to your actions in the interim.

##### Choose Factors

By assessing the context of the current situation, drawing on the discussion around your agenda and objectives, and taking the methods you're using to achieve it into consideration, **your FC may declare any additional relevant difficulty factors**.

There are generally two lists that the FC can draw factors from for every Task: A generic list, and a job-specific list. The generic list is given below, and the job specific lists are given in the example section of [[Jobs List|every job's]] individual description.

![[Generic Difficulty Factors]]

The [[Facilitator|FC]] should focus on _only the most important factors for the agenda:_ **Don't just select any and all facts that seem to apply**! Certain specific factors will seem to supersede generic ones too. Therefore, it is best to choose from the specific factors first, and then come to look at the generic factors to catch anything you missed.

❓ Alternatively, if you're using one of the conflict systems, like [[Martial Conflict|combat]] or [[Social Conflict|debate]], then the difficulty factors may be preestablished by the 'move' you're using and some small choices.

###### Table Talk

When you first start playing this game, the set-up phase can take a few minutes each time you go through it. Don't despair though, because _this is still a valid part of the game_. Which is to say, you don't stop playing just because you're now talking out-of-game with your friends — _so long as you're still talking about the game_.

It's usually worth the time spent talking, because a Task can often accomplish a lot more in a few minutes than _hours of play_ might do otherwise. And as you get used to the game and settle into your characters, the process and pacing should speed up eventually.

> ### Nb.
>
> These discussions are stictly _non-linear_, meaning that the order that you go through them may not be the same for every Task. Sometimes you may find you need to return to some parts again as the conversation flows, other times you may find you skip over the parts that are obvious or implicit.
>
> There's a back-and-forth to this process, and it's _conversational in nature_, not a one-sided decree.

![[Stressful Rolls]]

### 2. Roll Dice

**Roll all your gathered dice and _count successes_ for each face that lands on a number _equal to or greater than_ your rank.**

#### KISS your dice to _Reroll_ them!

**If the initial roll represents your raw talent or natural intuitions, then your '[[KISSing|Kismet, Insight, Stunts, and Specialties]]' represent techniques and skills _that you only use if you need to_**, or the spending of cosmic favors for another shot at success.

> ### Nb.
>
> **[[KISSing]] has it's own article of advice for players to browse** — which makes up the majority of the rolling phase — but here's the short version:
>
> - Mechanically, **each KISS lets you re-roll a die and count more successes** to help you overcome the factors that stand against you.
> - Narratively, _each KISS adds to the drama by raising the stakes, revealing new information, or letting you show off_.
>
> Remember to ‘keep it short and sweet’ too!

#### Helpers may KISS dice for you!

![[Helping]]

❗ **You must accept the results once you have KISSed and rolled all the dice you wanted to**, even if they're no better (or worse) than the initial roll. _There is only one round of KISSing per roll_.

### 3. Apply Outcomes

Once the rolling is finished and you have counted up all your successes you should have a pretty good idea of what's coming:

- **If you met or exceeded the target number of factors with successes, then you complete Task and fulfill your objectives**.
- **If you have fewer successes than the number of factors, then you fail the Task and _none_ of your objectives are properly fulfilled.**

Typically, once you've rolled for a Task, either you or your FC can _describe what the outcome looks like_.

Then your turn usually concludes, and _the consequences of your actions may haunt you for many more turns to come_, regardless of success or failure, and the game continues on as we '[[Let the dice fall where they may|let it ride]]'.

#### Margin of Success & Failure

**If you got more successes than the threshold**, the difference is called your 'margin of success'. This may, in some instances, be used to achieve an additional objective, or to attain an exceptional success; but only so long as it was preestablished before the roll. Otherwise, margin of success just means you can describe your success with aplomb.

Although, **if you manage to roll _twice the difficulty_ in successes** then the [[Facilitator|FC]] _should usually reward you with something extra_, even if it wasn't preestablished.

Similarly, **if you failed by a small margin**, then you may describe which factors were overcome and which ones ultimately foiled you. This is mostly for narrative effect though — _the main consequences of failure will still be applied._

#### Gaining Experience from a Roll

When you perform a Task, _regardless of success or failure_, **you will gain a point of _[[Earning Experience|experience]]_ in the job you just used**. Filling in the next _'exp'_ diamond on your character sheet under that job's name (ie.  ◇ → ◆).

If you failed the roll then **add an additional point of exp** to represent _learning from your mistakes_.
