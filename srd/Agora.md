###### ❗ Version 0.5.1 ❗

**You are currently reading a work in progress.** You _will_ encounter [[broken links]], typos, and #unfinished tags.

The core game is now fully playable, though the character creation options are still somewhat limited, and there's no magic system yet. If you use the premade archetypes then you can only really play as _human adventurers_ right now. Otherwise, you will have to make up you own archetypes.

_If you like what you see, then consider joining the [Discord.gg/JwM6zBszKr](https://discord.gg/JwM6zBszKr) or following me on twitter [@SeraaronArt](https://twitter.com/SeraaronArt) for more regular updates and early drafts of 'beta' material._
