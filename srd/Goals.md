### Goals

These are **the [[Principles|principles]] that your character wants to achieve** over the course of the next few game sessions, or before the end of the current [[Campaign Arcs|arc]].

They should be fairly _direct and promissory_, not wishful, and are best written in first person with the future tense.

> ### Eg.
>
> - "I _will_ get my revenge..." **not**, "I would like to get revenge..."
> - "We _must_ escape..." **rather than**, "We should try to escape..."

‚ùó Try to avoid adding qualifying statements unless they help you to clarify a general motive, and still fit within a single sentence.

#### Advancing a Goal Earns a Lot

Whenever you _notably advance one of your Goals during play_ you will be **awarded with a [[Lots|Lot]]** at the [[End-of-Session Lot Rewards|end of the session]].

#### Finishing a Goal Generates Ego

When a Goal is _completed_, you may **regain [[Ego]]** at the [[End-of-Session Ego Rewards|end of the session]] instead.
