## Tier

Different types of characters can be grouped together under different tiers. The tier will set the base 'power level' for a character, and it may be that certain [[Character Assembly#Concept Concept Concept|character concepts]] simply won't make sense at certain tiers. Tier primarily affects your [[Rank|ability ranks]], and so you can also think of it as a 'difficulty setting', where a lower tier makes the game _statistically harder_.

Therefore, **everyone should make characters of the same tier**, unless you have your _[[Peers]] permission_ to make characters of differing tiers.

❓ Write your tier in parentheses next to your campaign's name on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]].

❗ You can only [[Development Sessions#Changing Tier|change your tier]] during [[Development Sessions|development sessions]].

![[Tier Benefits]]

The ability rank arrays are a set of numbers that you should spread out among your [[Rank|ability ranks]], assigning one number to each ability. The bonus 'caps' — [[Character Assembly#4 Character Assembly Points|character assembly points]] — may be spent towards the end of [[Character Assembly|character creation]] to give your character a few extra treats.

###### Tiers Explained

The four playable tiers, from lowest to highest, are: **Ordinary**, **Heroic**, **Legendary**, and **Mythic**.

- **Ordinary Tier** represents fairly historically accurate characters acting in an assumedly normal world. (It represents people like you, _the reader_, and nearly everyone else who has ever lived and died on Earth). This tier is best used for telling believable stories about  realistic people, or for generating 'pulpy' fiction where life is cheap and your luck can quickly run short.

- **Heroic Tier** is for telling thrilling tales about people who quest for glory or struggle to leave their mark on the annals of history. People who want to influence a whole nation, or create a new one, or become living legends. Historically, these are people whose efforts may not have been really possible without either a storyteller's embellishments or _a true touch of magic._

- **Legendary Tier** is the place of gifted-rogues, warrior-poets, adventurer-prophets, philosopher-engineers, and sorcerer-monarchs; where paranormal events occur regularly, _epic deeds_ are performed with some regularity, and even absurd wishes can come true — usually with disastrous consequences.

- **Mythic Tier** characters may be ascended mortals, real-life superheroes, daimons or demigods, or a shard of an even greater being given mortal form. They are not omnipotent or flawless though, there is still room for them to grow and learn from the world before their apotheosis (or inevitable doom).

- **Deific Tier** is _typically unplayable_, but should you need to represent [[Non-player Characters*|NPCs]] at this tier then the [[Tier Benefits|sum total]] of their ability ranks should be 15 or less. It represents gods, demons, and ancient dragons, the fâe lords, augustine supercomputers, or the dreaming eldritch spawn, and all their ilk.
