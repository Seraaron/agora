## Ranks

Your [[Abilities]] all have a number assigned to them called 'rank'. This is a rating between 1 and 6, where **the lower the number the higher your _potential_ to succeed** at [[Checks]] and [[Tasks]] involving that ability (or  [[Capabilities|capability]]).

You can think of 'ranks' as places in a competition — ie. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th — if using _ordinal numbers_ helps you to remember that _lower ranked numbers are better_.

Rank is applied to your dice before rolling them, and which rank you use depends on what you're doing. **You count successes on a die if it lands on a face that is _equal to or higher_ than its rank**.

> ### Eg.
>
> - If you have _four dice at rank **5**_ and roll _‘2, 3, **5**, **6**’_ then you count **two** successes!
> - If you have _three dice at rank **6**_ and roll _‘1, 4, 5’_ then you count **zero** successes!
> - If you have _eight dice at rank **3**_ and roll _‘1, 1, 2, **3**, **3**, **4**, **5**, **6**’_ then you count **five** successes!

### Interpreting Ranks

You may interpret your ranks, then, as a representation of your character's natural talents; but they also represent a _honed efficacy_, as they can _slowly but surely_ be increased by playing the game ([[#Advancing Rank|see below]]).

|  Rank | Success Chance _/ die_ | Narrative Interpretation                                                                      |
| :---: | :--------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **6** |         16.67%         | Others might think you inexperienced, inept, or otherwise find you lacking in this department |
| **5** |         33.34%         | You are _roughly on par_ with any average person here                                         |
| **4** |          50.0%         | Other people would say that you have a 'natural talent' for this sort of thing                |
| **3** |         66.67%         | Your competency is among the best in the world                                                |
| **2** |         83.34%         | People often say you must be blessed by fate, or believe you to be a supernatural being       |
| **1** |          100%          | You are _unrivaled_ in this capacity                                                          |

The above table should give you an idea how each rank relates to one another. Rank 5 is considered the norm for most folks, regardless of species or gender. Most starting [[Player Characters]] should not expect to have more than one or two abilities deviate from this norm.

#question The only way to start the game with significantly better ranks is by raising the [[Tier|tier]] of your whole character; which is an optional rule, and naturally requires [[Peers|Peer approval]].

### Choosing which Ability Rank to use

Rank is tied to each ability, and to each capability. Each [[Jobs|job]] also has an ability listed next to it:

- If you're making a [[Checks|Check]] then choose the ability rank based on the main _verb_ you've used to describe your action.
- If you're performing a [[Tasks|Task]] then the job you've chosen will tell you which ability's rank to use.

**If you're stuck choosing between two or more abilities, _but their ranks are the same_, then just get on with the roll.** It's only worth debating the semantics if there's a difference between the ranks.

### Advancing Ranks

There are two main ways to advance ranks in this game, and one optional method:

- The first is to [[Kismet#Earning Fidelity|earn four Fidelity]] and then spend it [[KISSing#Kismet|while KISSing]] to _permanently advance_ your rank in the ability you're currently rolling.

- And optionally, during a [[Development Sessions|development session]] (and usually after a [[Downtime and Travel|time-skip]]), you may decide _as a group_ to raise your character's [[Tier|tier]] which _reduces the worst possible_ rank for that character.

- And optionally, special [[Features]] may _temporarily advance_ the rank of a roll when certain conditions are met.

**When your rank advances, it does so by one 'step'.** This means rank 6 goes to rank 5, rank 5 goes to rank 4, and so on. These steps are represented with plain-text arrows in other sections (ie. 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1), as a reminder.

> ##### Similarly, when you see up and down arrows:
>
> - **↑X** - Means advance the rank by X steps.
> - **↓Y** - Means regress the rank by Y steps.

###### Rank 1

**Rank 1 is more of a _theoretical ideal_ than an achievable reality**. _You cannot start the game with rank 1 in anything_, and **you cannot permanently advanced any ability to rank 1**. The only way to get rank 1 is by spending [[Fidelity]], or using certain [[Features]], on a rank 2 ability for the temporary boost, but a full gauge cannot be spent for a permanent advancement to rank 1.

### Regressing Ranks

The main way to lose rank is to get [[Wounds and Scars|wounded]], which _temporarily regresses_ an appropriate your ability rank by one step (ie. 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6) until you recover.

#question Special [[Capabilities|capabilities]], like [[Capabilities#Honor|Honor]], also have mechanics for regressing ranks when certain conditions arise.
