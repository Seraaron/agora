# Peers

**Your 'Peers' means everyone else currently at the table.**

It's a _relative term_, so your [[Facilitator|Facilitator's]] Peers are all of their players, including you. Another player's Peers include you, the FC, and everyone else. Even then, _a Peer does not even need to be a player_ — they might just be a friend who knows the rules of the game who's sitting in on the session and listening.

> ##### The duties of a good Peer primarily include:
>
> -   **Playing to find out what happens next** and being a fan of the other [[Player Characters]], even if your own character find themselves opposed against them.
>
> -   **Offering guidance or help when asked**, or offering suggestions to struggling players to help them write good [[Principles]].
>
> -   **Helping to adjudicate the game rules** to reduce the referential and managerial duties of the [[Facilitator|FC]], and otherwise being cordial and attentive, when it isn't your [[Session Structure#Turns|turn]].
>
> -   **Taking and sharing [[Taking notes|notes]]** about the events of each session — such as _the names of places and people_, and memorable moments in play. (Such notes are especially useful to share during [[Development Sessions|development sessions]]).
>
> -   **Discussing the game** with each other and with their other friends outside of session time, or sharing their experiences on the internet with a campaign report, art, vlogs, or other creative outlets.

## How to use your Peers?

Peers are a useful game concept, because they broaden each player's role at the table beyond the simple 'PC vs. GM' dichotomy that is found in many other tabletop roleplaying games.

They don't just exist to aid new or struggling players though, they also implicitly make the game feel more _wholly collaborative_. Their existence deemphasizes a [Gamemaster's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) role as the sole arbitrator, hence why [[Agora]] uses the word '[[Facilitator]]' instead.

> ### Nb.
> By giving them a proper name, like 'Peers', on par with the 'Facilitator' and the 'Player Characters', they enable any player (including the FC) to openly call out to their Peers for input if they feel stuck or lost.  They also allow us to _explicitly defer to them in the game's rules_ when Peer input is desired over a singular (and potentially arbitrary) judgment from the FC.

### Decision Making

Using Peers means we can [make decisions by consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making) whenever we feel we need to. This promotes an atmosphere at the table where everyone feels they can contribute. And the input of Peers is also highly valued when [[Houserules and Temporary Rulings|changing the game's rules]], and when [[Development Sessions#Changing Features and Specialties|changing character aspects]], via a [[#Peer Votes|vote]] if necessary.

> ### Eg.
> During [[Development Sessions#Session zero|session zero]] when the players are discussing the world and the starting situation, their characters and motivations, and what [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|themes]] they want to see in the upcoming [[Campaign Arcs|campaign]]. In these moments _the players are already playing_, not as PCs, _but as Peers_.

Finally, Peers can also function as sort of _fail-safe_ for any other [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] you may be already using. RPGs are games where, *if you're not careful*, one player can easily ruin another's enjoyment. So if your Peers all trust each other then they can help keep everyone else in check, which takes additional pressure off of any one individual.

###### Alternative words for 'Peers'

If the word 'Peer' seems a bit [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group), [technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer), or [archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage) to you, then maybe try some words like 'Jury',  'Board', or 'Table' and see if they feel right, or maybe just say _'friends'_.

Either way, [[Agora]] uses 'Peers' as a _proper noun_ throughout.

#### Not _everything_ is a discussion...

There is one major draw-back to using Peers, and that's that they can sometimes slow down the pace of the game. While there are many times when Peer input is desired that of a single voice, **_usually_ the FC's decision takes presidency** (particularly in matters that directly involve the [[Facilitator|duties of a Facilitator]]). This structure is required to make sure that a session isn't too bogged down by innocuous or semantic discussions.

The main kinds of discussions you _want_ to have with your Peers are those about 'where to take the game next' (in broad strokes), or 'finding and interpreting a given rule', and 'round-table discussions involving feedback or  suggestions'.

❓ You can think about it in terms of striking a balance between the two phrases _"many hands make light work"_ and _"too many cooks spoil the broth"_.

### Direct Emotions, Not Actions

Discussions about potential upcoming [[Session Structure#Scenes|scenes]] are possible, but try to avoid getting too _'writerly'_. That is, if you're not careful then you can waste a lot of time discussing what a scene will 'be about' or deciding in advance 'what will happen' without realizing, which could have just been spent playing the scene and having more fun.

Remember, one of your duties as a Peer is to _play to find out what happens_, and the FC is there to _play the world_. A scene might not initially seem to have any tension or drama, but you will probably find some simply by roleplaying and seeing what's in store for you.

In fact, **not every scene needs drama**: Certain scenes — such as [[Stress#Stress Relieving Scenes|stress relief scenes]] — exist _specifically_ to give you a break from any external tensions.

### Overruling the FC

There are rare occasions when the FC may make a creative decision or a pass a ruling that the rest of the group is simply unhappy with. In these cases, the **Peers _do_ have the power to overrule their FC's decision if they unanimously agree to**. When this happens, the FC should not feel guilty or abashed about it — _just gracefully accept the decision and move on with the game_ — but it should always be brought up in a [[Script Change Tools#⏏️ Wrap Up|wrap up discussion]] at the end of that session, to make sure everyone is still okay with the result.

If overrulings are happening frequently — as in, more than a few times every campaign arc — then the FC may become unhappy, as they may feel like they are being denied too much of their creative vision for the campaign. This is a when a more thorough out-of-game discussion needs to happen, probably in the form of a [[Development Sessions|development session]], to try to come to a collective agreement about the direction of the game.

If no agreement can be reached, then it may be that this _style of play_ (or perhaps  the entire game?) simply isn't working for your group or your Facilitator, and you may want to try something else.


### Peer Votes

A useful function of Peers is their ability to help us make decisions at the table by consensus, especially during [[Development Sessions|development sessions]]. There are many reasons why you might want to conduct a peer vote, but here's a few suggestions:
- A player wants to change something on their character sheet, and needs input from everyone to come to a decision a — such as altering one of their [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|features]] or changing their whole [[Development Sessions#Changing Tier|character tier]].
- The Faciliator wants to take the game in a new direction, change the [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|game's tone]], or wants to introduce a new idea in the upcoming arc, but isn't sure if everyone will be on board.
- A Peer wants to change a core game rule or introduce a [[Houserules and Temporary Rulings|houserule]] that will alter the way the group plays for the rest of the campaign. 
- If a player wants to [[Character Assembly|make a new character midgame]] then everyone should be given the opportunity to review and approve that character before they can be played, so that they're not too deemed 'too imbalanced' or 'a poor fit' for the group.

❗ You may find other uses for conducting a peer vote through play too.

How you conduct a peer vote — that is, whether a vote should be cast blind or openly, and how many votes are needed to pass a motion, and who acts as a tie breaker — is up to you and your group and the type of issue at stake, but some advice is offered for the specific case of [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|characting character features]].
