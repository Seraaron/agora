# Peers

##### **Your 'Peers' means everyone else currently at the table.**

It's a _relative term_, so your [[Facilitator|Facilitator's]] Peers are all of their players, including you; and another player's Peers include you, the FC, and everyone else; and even then, _a Peer does not even need to be a player_: they might just be a friend sitting in on the session and listening.

> ##### The duties of a good Peer primarily include:
>
> - **Playing to find out what happens next** and being a fan of the other [[Player Characters]], even if your own character find themselves opposed to against them.
>
> - **Offering guidance or help when asked**, or offering suggestions to struggling players to help them write good [[Principles]].
>
> - **Helping to adjudicate the game rules** to reduce the referential and managerial duties of the [[Facilitator|FC]], and otherwise being cordial and attentive, when it isn't your [[Turns|turn]].
>
> - **Taking and sharing [[Taking notes|notes]]** about the events of each session; such as _the names of places and people_, and memorable moments in play. (Such notes are especially useful in [[Debriefings|debriefings]] and [[Development sessions|development sessions]]).
>
> - **Discussing the game** with each other and with their other friends outside of session time, or sharing their experiences on the internet with a campaign report, art, vlogs, or other creative outlets.

## How to use your Peers?

Peers are a useful game concept, because they broaden each player's role at the table beyond the simple 'PC vs. GM' dichotomy that is found in many other tabletop roleplaying games.

They don't just exist to aid new or struggling players though; they also implicitly make the game feel more _wholly collaborative_. Their existence deemphasizes a [Gamemaster's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) role as the sole arbitrator, hence why [[Agora]] uses the word '[[Facilitator]]' instead.

> #nb
> By giving them a proper name, like 'Peers', on par with the 'Facilitator' and the 'Player Characters', they enable any player (including the FC) to openly call out to their Peers for input if they feel stuck or lost; and they allow us to _explicitly defer to them in the game's rules_ when Peer input is desired over a singular (and potentially arbitrary) judgment from the FC.

Using Peers means we can [make decisions by consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making) whenever we feel we need to. This promotes an atmosphere at the table where everyone feels they can contribute. And the input of Peers is also highly valued when [[Houserules and Temporary Rulings|changing the game's rules]], and when [[Development sessions#Changing Features and Specialties|changing character aspects]], via a _vote_ if necessary.

> #eg
> During a [[Development sessions#Session zero|session zero]] when the players are discussing the world and the starting situation, their characters and motivations, and what [[Genre, tone, and themes|themes]] they want to see in the upcomingÂ [[Campaign structure|campaign]]; in these moments _the players are already playing_, not as PCs, _but as Peers_.

Finally, Peers can also function a sort of _fail-safe_ for any other [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] you may be already using; because if your Peers all trust each other then they can help keep everyone else in check, which takes additional pressure off of any one individual.

###### Alternative words for 'Peers'

If the word 'Peer' seems a bit [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group), [technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer), or [archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage) to you, then maybe try some words like 'Jury',  'Board', or 'Table' and see if they feel right, or maybe just say _'friends'_.

Either way, [[Agora]] uses 'Peers' as a _proper noun_ throughout.
