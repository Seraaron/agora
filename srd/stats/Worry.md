#### Worry ([[Appeal|App]])

Being _worried_ is the [[Stress|stress]] of [[Appeal]]. It represents a mixed bag of feelings: Nervousness, frustration, or unease, and perhaps some feelings of dread, insecurity, or powerlessness too. You are your own worst enemy while you're worried, as you doubt and fret and pace about.

##### Remedies for Worry

**Worry must be remedied by taking some time out for yourself:** _Whatever it may be that suits your character's personal wants and needs, and which will calm them._ Give yourself a break, basically.

> #eg
> Have a day at the beach, or the spa, or spend some time in nature; get a manicure and a haircut; make some art or attend to your hobbies; go buy yourself some new clothes or get that thing you've wanted.
