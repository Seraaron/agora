#### Hunger ([[Endurance|End]])

Being _hungry_ is the [[Stress|stress]] of [[Endurance]]. It's not just your physical need for food, it's _a deeper yearning for the finer things in life_. It means that you're tired of rations, and watered-down wine, and living on the margins. Hunger makes you irrational, greedy, and weirdly unwilling to work. It can also make you tired and irritable.

##### Remedies for Hunger

**Hunger must be remedied by feasting and celebrating life, or by sharing your favor and fortune with others**. _Food alone will not sate hunger_. A proper meal and a drink, with stories and music, all in the company of good friends, _that is what's truly needed!_
