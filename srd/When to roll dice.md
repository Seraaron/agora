### When do we roll dice?

Dice are primarily used in this game to simulate a combination of skill and luck, when attempting to complete _non-trivial activities_.  Meaning that _no roll is even necessary_ to do what you want to do **when there is nothing at stake**.

In these low-stakes cases, the [[Facilitator]] may move on to keep a good session pace, or could come back to you when you're ready to push for a stronger [[Agenda|agenda]].


#### Saying 'Yes'

Vincent Baker, co-creator of [Apocalypse World](https://www.apocalypse-world.com/), put it best in his first game [Dogs in the Vinyard](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/274623/Dogs) with the phrase, "**Roll dice, or _say ‘yes’_**."

But the converse is also true, meaning, "When there is _conflict_, roll dice."

#### Saying 'No'

It's also fair to say though that the above is _just a heuristic_, not a universal truth. Since 2004 we have discovered through play and discussion that there are several times when you have to _say 'No'_ to things too, either as a [[Player Characters|PC]] or as an [[Facilitator|FC]].

Players can follow these guides to avoid being told 'No':

-   **Don't cross a line:** If you've gone through the [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] with you group then this should be easy enough to avoid. So attempting to cross any pre-established lines, or doing things that players have explicitly said they don't want to see in the game, should be met with an immediate 'No'.

-   **Don't jam the tone:** Similarly, if you ran a full [[Development Sessions|development session]], then you would have also covered [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|themes, tones, and player expectations]]. So if your behavior would _significantly disrupt_ that established game-feel, you may be asked to reconsider your actions by your [[Peers]].

-   **Don't go out of bounds:** Your FC has likely spent a lot of their free time [[Pitching and Planning*|preparing a game]] for you to play and enjoy, and thinking of ways to [[Challenging Principles|challenge your Principles]]. If you want to suddenly go off in a direction that they have nothing planned for, then you may be told _'not today'_, or you may simply be told that what you've asked is just not possible within the constraints of the fiction or the [[Worldbuilding*|rules of the world]].

-   **Don't challenge backgrounds:** The PCs all have [[Circumstances#Background Traits|background circumstances]] that defines their core concept, culture, and appearance. Players can opt to put some of these features into the 'foreground', meaning they are _changeable_. However, the power to change them still lies solely in the hands of that character's player. You are certainly encouraged to incorporate the character's background into the game and setting, but expect to be told 'No' if you try to challenge one directly.

> ### Nb.
> You may find through play that there are other times you want to say 'No' too. Therefore, **any player can pause the game to discuss the intent of an action any time before rolling dice**, if they feel it's something that should be scrutinized before committing to anything.
