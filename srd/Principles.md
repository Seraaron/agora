# Principles

Principles are a way for you to _express your character's personality and motivations_, by writing a few short sentences on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]] labeled **[[Goals]]**, **[[Habits]]**, and **[[Creeds]]**.

**You may have up to six principles in total** — usually two of each type — unless you have permission from your [[Facilitator|FC]] to add more. **Each one can only be a single sentence**, so there is a bit of a technique to writing _succinct and punchy principles_.

❗ **Principles help you to [[Agenda|find your agenda]]** and earn you [[Kismet|kismet]].

## Types of Principle:

![[Goals]]

![[Habits]]

![[Creeds]]

## Changing Principles

You can generally only write new principles during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] and at the end of every [[Campaign Arcs|arc]] thereafter, or during [[Downtime and Travel*|downtime]]. This is because your [[Facilitator|FC]] probably has something [[Challenging Principles|planned for your current principles]].

Re-wording a principle before a session starts without changing it's core message is acceptable _if your [[Peers]] agree_. If you're using the '[[#Discovering Principles|discovery]]' rules, then **finding your principles during play** becomes a part of the game. _Otherwise, changing  principles mid-session is usually only done at dramatically appropriate times._

### Broken Principles

**When you break a principle during play**, and roleplay appropriately — showing your conflicted emotions, pleading for forgiveness, or having a dramatic change of heart — **you will immediately regain your [[Ego]]**.

If the principle was a [[Creeds|Creed]] then you'll also regain [[Health]].

If the principle ultimately went unbroken, but you still played it out well, then you'll gain a [[Lots|Lot]] at the [[End-of-Session Lot Rewards|end of the session]]. 

### Discovering Principles

If players are finding the process of thinking of [[Principles|principles]] from scratch exhausting, or simply not suitable for their [[Player Styles|style of play]], then this way of playing may be more appropriate.

If you **leave a principle slot intentionally blank**, then you can *wait until you think of something to fill it with*.

The new principle is usually inspired by things that have happened in the setting, a new situation your character finds themselves in, or as a direct response to something that happened during play.

Sometimes your character will say something in character that they believe in, _or acts in a new and unexpected way_, and a new principle condenses in that same moment. **We call these moments 'discoveries'.**

## Duds

**Your [[Peers]] can veto any principle which you present to them that they think would either be too disruptive or wouldn't go anywhere**, or which are _too easy_ to complete, trigger, or uphold (respectively). This _especially includes_ any Creeds which they suspect you have written purely with the intention of changing later just in order to [[Health#Healing|recover Health]].

_These kinds of principles are called '**duds**',_ meaning that they are ineffectual, misfits for the campaign, or will fail to _narratively explode_ as intended.

###### Old Habits Die Hard

If you're new to this _style of game_, or new to roleplaying games in general, then it's possible that you're not used to this much agency and creative liberty over the direction of a story and the personal destinies of your characters.

If this is you, then that's okay, there's just a good chance that your first few principles will be duds. Don't worry too much! If you're still learning, or _unlearning_, then you may end up playing several sessions with a dud without realizing it. You'll likely still be rewarded for this _if none of your [[Peers]] notice_, and that's fine too.

**The key is to recognize them, change them, and then move on**, rather than clinging on for weeks trying to make them work.  _Every game requires it's own set of skills_, and as with all skills, the more you practice the better you get.
