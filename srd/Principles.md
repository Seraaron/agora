# Principles

Principles are a way for you to _express your character's personality and motivations_, by writing a few short sentences on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] labeled **[[Goals]]**, **[[Habits]]**, and **[[Creeds]]**.

**You may have up to six principles in total** — usually two of each type — unless you have permission from your [[Facilitator|FC]] to add more. **Each one can only be a single sentence**, so there is a bit of a technique to writing _succinct and punchy principles_.

#imp Ultimately, **principles help you to [[Agenda|find your agenda]]** and earn you [[Kismet|kismet]].

## Types of Principle:

![[Goals]]

![[Habits]]

![[Creeds]]

## Changing Principles

You can generally only write new principles during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] and at the end of every [[Campaign Arcs|arc]] thereafter or during [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]]. This is because your [[Facilitator|FC]] probably has something [[Challenging Principles|planned for your current principles]].

Re-wording a principle before a session starts without changing it's core message is acceptable _if your [[Peers]] agree_. If you're using the '[[Discovering Principles|discovery]]' rules (below), then **finding your principles during play** becomes a part of the game. _Otherwise, changing  principles mid-session is usually only done at dramatically appropriate times._

## Duds

**Your [[Peers]] can veto any Principle which you present to them that they think would either be too disruptive or wouldn't go anywhere**; or which are _too easy_ to complete, trigger, or uphold (respectively); especially any creeds which they suspect you have written purely with the intention of changing later just in order to [[Health#Healing|recover Health]].

_These kinds of principles are called '**duds**',_ meaning that they are ineffectual, misfits for the campaign, or will fail to _narratively explode_ as intended.

###### Old Instincts Die Hard

If you're new to this _style of game_, or new to roleplaying games in general, then it's possible that you're not used to this much agency and creative liberty over the direction of a story and the personal destinies of your characters.

If this is you, then that's okay, there's just a good chance that your first few Principles will be duds (or at least not as good as the ones you'll learn to write later). Don't worry too much! If you're still learning, or _unlearning_, then you may end up playing several sessions with a dud without realizing it. You'll still be rewarded for this, as per the [[Kismet|Kismet rules]], _if none of your [[Peers]] notice_, and that's fine too.

**The key is to recognize them, change them, and then move on**; rather than clinging on for weeks trying to make them work.  _Every game requires it's own set of skills_, and as with all skills, the more you practice the better you get: So get out there, [[Character Assembly|go make a character]], write some Principles, play the game, _possibly die_ (or retire?), and then do it all again!
