### Let the dice rest where they may…

We use the phrase “let them rest” in [[Agora]] to pull *triple-duty*, referring to three philosophies of play at once:

-   That you should respect your dice as *oracles of our character's fates*; and thus we should roll *openly and without fear*, and we shouldn't try to 'fudge' or manipulate[[#Notes|¹]] our dice.
-   That **you shouldn't roll more than once against any one obstacle**, and *you should not roll again against that same obstacle until the initial consequences are dealt with*, or until your circumstances change.
-   And that if something is [[When to roll dice|worth rolling for]], then the potential outcomes of failure are just as important as the potential outcomes of success.

### Exceptions

As with [[When to roll dice#Saying 'Yes'|saying 'yes']], *there are [[When to roll dice#Saying 'No'|exceptions]] to this principle*.

First are [[Checks]] which, with their more limited scope, allow for more frequent reattempts than [[Tasks]]. This doesn't mean that a failed Check doesn't do anything — the [[Consequences|consequences]] of each failure should still *play out as discussed* — but that failing a Check often doesn't preclude the opportunity to try again[[#Notes|²]] in the same way that a failed [[Tasks|Task]] _might_.

#### When to ‘take it from the top’?

Other times you need to **rewind the whole game back a few moments**, _void any related dice rolls_, and go back to the start of a roll, a turn, or a scene. Such as when:

- **Stakes weren't set and a player rolled too soon,** without hearing the consequences. So, *to be fair to your destiny*, you should roll again and ignore whatever your dice just said would happen.

- **A player's intent was misinterpreted** or when _the stakes were set far higher than anticipated_. This is most likely to occur when a player wasn't _clear enough[[#Notes|³]]_ about about their agenda, or when an FC makes too many assumptions and jumps the gun.

- **A hard line was crossed** and a player simply wants to rewind _as far back as they need to_ — even into previous scenes if needs be — until they reach a point where they feel comfortable again. This [[Script Change Tools#⏪ Rewind|rewinding]] process is discussed in greater detail in the '[[Script Change Tools]]' article.

> #nb
> You may find through play that there are other times you want to take it from the top too. Therefore, any player can ask to take a step back or to rewind at any time, within reason.
> 
> Though, this way is mostly a 'meta'-consideration: Dire consequences may be hounding your characters all the time, in game, but only if you've understood and accepted their fate before you put them in those positions.

#### Retroactive-Continuity

If you realize at some point that you should have rewound in an earlier scene or session, then mention it during a [[Script Change Tools#⏫ Wrap Up|wrap up meeting]], [[Debriefing|session debriefing]], or between sessions to your [[Peers]], and decide what (if anything) you'd like to '[ret-con](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retcon)'.

###### Notes

1.  Though, frankly, if you feel the need to cheat at a tabletop roleplaying game with your friends, then you need to have a chat with them — or your therapist — about why you think you can exploit their trust.
2.  This is why Checks sometimes use the word 'miss' for a failed roll, because missing implies that you can try again. You aren't always _literally_ hitting or missing something with a Check; but perhaps _metaphorically_ you are?
3.  This can be especially common with new players who are not used to having to [[Principles|fight for their principles]] so readily, but the onus is on _everyone_ to encourage them to lay out their intentions to the best of their abilities so they have a _fair shot_ at getting what they want.
