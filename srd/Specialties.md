# Specialties

Specialties can represent a great range of things: Fields of study, disciplines, or subjects of particular interest to you; specialist training you've received; hobbies; places or people you're overly-familiar with; languages or histories you've learned; traits or talents that aid you in your work; or, just a certain aptitude or working knowledge you've garnered over time.

#### Using Specialties

**Each specialty can be _actively used_, once per session, in one of two ways:**

- **[[KISSing|KISS]] a die to re-roll it** while performing a relevant [[Checks vs. Tasks|roll]].
- **[[Fact Checks|Establish a fact]] about the topic** by making an appropriate [[Checks|Check]].

Once a specialty has been actively used, lightly fill in or tick the circle symbol next to it on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] (ie. ◯ → ⬤). Then erase all the filled circles at the end of the session, so they're fresh for next time.

![[Fact Checks]]

## Passive Uses

A specialty can also inform you that your character is proficient, capable, and comfortable with the thing in question, _without the need for a roll;_ which may allow you to do things which wouldn't otherwise be possible, or prevent you from being penalized. *This is similar to how [[Habits#Habits are Versatile|certain habits]] can work. *

> ### Eg.
> The 'Literacy' specialty lets you read and write in your native language, and in any other languages that you have a specialty in ([[#Using language Specialties|see below]]).

#question _These 'passive uses' are always available to you_, even once the specialty has exhausted its active use for the session.

## [generic] Specialties

When you see a generic noun listed as a specialty in lower-case between square-brackets, [like this], it means that there are many potential specialties like it. When you add one to your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] you should place a proper noun or an adjective specific to that specialty before the word in the square brackets, to identify it.

> ### Eg.
> The specialty *[city]* should become *London [city]* when you add it to your sheet if your character lived or worked in or around London a lot, rather than interpreting it to mean a specialty for _any_ city.

###### Using [language] Specialties

Languages have a special use case. As with any [[#generic Specialties|generic specialty,]] a '[language]' specialty should be appended with a named language of your choice:

> ### Eg.
> Such as *English [language]*, *Malay [language]*, or *Swahili [language]*, or whatever setting-appropriate language you like, such as *Goblin [language]* or *Toki Pona [language]*.

Having a [language] specialty passively informs us that you can speak that language with passing accuracy (and read and write in it fairly well too, if you also have the 'Literacy' specialty), [[When to roll dice|without a roll]].

But instead of being actively used to [[#Fact Checks|establish facts]], language specialties can be used with [[Appeal]] to 'find the right words' _and express yourself for a scene in that language without the risk of being misunderstood_. Your degree of success, then, determines the complexity of the ideas you're able to accurately convey.

#question This _example case_, using languages, should serve as a model for how you might use other specialties in combination with a [[Checks|Check]] too.

## Learning new Specialties

Beyond [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] there are three ways to learn new specialties:

- **When you fail to uphold a [[Creeds|Creed]] for any reason**, but usually when [[Health#Healing|regaining Health]], **you will learn something from the experience in the form of a new specialty**.
	- This can either be earned immediately, or you can wait until the end of the [[Campaign Arcs|arc]] to discuss it.
- **You can learn a new specialty during a [[Downtime and Travel|downtime skip]] of one or more *years***, so long as you can find an appropriate mentor, course, or school.
- **Your [[Facilitator|FC]] can also award you with a new specialty at any time** _if they think you've done enough during the course of a campaign to earn it_.
	- Though this is usually done during a [[Development Sessions|development session]] as a reward for keeping a [[Habits|Habit]] for long enough.

### Inventing new Specialties

Specialties are just words — usually pluralized nouns, proper nouns, or short evocative phrases — with brief explanations attached to them in the [[Specialties List|specialties list]] to remind you what they mean.

**Making up new specialties is quite easy:**
1. Identify something that you think is missing in the list, or identify something specific to your setting or character that you'd like to represent with a specialty.
2. Think of how it would be actively used, to establish facts or do something else of interest.
3. *Optionally:* Think of a fun little passive use that mostly adds flavor, rather than anything that adds new mechanics or requires you to do any extra bookkeeping.
4. Check with your [[Peers]] that it's okay, and then write it down.

**Alternatively:** If you *do* want something a little 'crunchier' then adding to the [[Perks List]] might be a better idea instead.
