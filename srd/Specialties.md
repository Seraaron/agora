## Specialties

Specialties can represent a great range of things: Fields of study, disciplines, or subjects of particular interest to you; specialist training you've received; hobbies; places or people you're overly-familiar with; languages you speak; histories you've learned about; simple traits or talents that aid you in your work; or just a certain natural aptitude you've garnered over time.

### Using Specialties

**Each specialty can be _actively used_ once per session to [[KISSing|KISS]] a die, to re-roll, it while performing _any_ relevant dice roll**. _Suggestions are given in the [[Specialties List]] for cases when each might be used_.

Once a specialty has been actively used, put a checkmark ✓ in the circle next to their name on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]]. Then erase all the marks at the end of the session, so they're fresh for next time.

❓ You can prematurely refresh the use of a specialty _before the end of a session_ by '[[Conditions#Accepting Your Fate|accepting your fate]]' while using a [[Conditions|condition]] to handicap yourself.

#### Passive Uses

A specialty can also inform you that your character is proficient, capable, and comfortable with the thing in question, _without the need for a roll_. This may allow you to do things which wouldn't otherwise be possible, or prevent you from being penalized. _This is similar to how [[Habits]] can work, and can also be used to justify a [[Fact Checks|Fact check]]._

> ### Eg.
>
> The 'Literacy' specialty lets you read and write in your native language, and in any other languages that you have a specialty in ([[#Using language Specialties|see below]]).

❓ _These 'passive uses' are always available to you_, even once the specialty has exhausted its active use for the session.

### [Generic] Specialties

When you see a generic noun listed as _a specialty in lower-case between square-brackets_ [like this], it means that there are many potential specialties like it. When you add one to your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] you should **replace or append the generic noun with a capitalized _specific noun_ or an adjective or phrase related to it**, to identify it.

Generic specialties are especially useful for [[Fact Checks|establishing facts]].

> ### Eg.
>
> The _'[city]'_ specialty should become _'London City'_ or _'City of London'_ or just _'London [city]'_ when you add it to your sheet if your character lived or worked in or around London a lot, rather than interpreting it to mean a specialty for _any_ city.

❓ How you decide to write it on your sheet is your own aesthetic choice, but when prespecified generics are listed in [[Agora]] we use the form _'Specific [generic]'_.

###### Using [Language] Specialties

Languages have a special use case. As with any [[#generic Specialties|generic specialty,]] a '[language]' specialty should be appended with a named language of your choice:

> ### Eg.
>
> Such as _English_, _Malay_, or _Swahili_, or whatever setting-appropriate language you like, such as _Goblin_ or _Toki Pona_.

Having a [language] specialty passively informs us that you can speak that language with passing accuracy (and read and write in it fairly well too, if you also have the 'Literacy' specialty), without a roll.

Instead of being used to make [[Fact Checks|Fact checks]], language specialties can be used with an [[Appeal]] check to '**find the right words**' _and express yourself for a scene in that language without the risk of being misunderstood_. Your degree of success, then, determines the complexity of the ideas you're able to accurately convey.

❓ This _example case_, using languages, should serve as a model for how you might use other specialties in combination with a [[Checks|Check]] too.

### Learning New Specialties

Beyond [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] there are three ways to learn new specialties:

- **When you fail to uphold a [[Creeds|Creed]] for any reason** — but usually when [[Health#Healing|regaining Health]] — **you will learn something from the experience in the form of a new specialty**, gained at the end of the current [[Campaign Arcs|arc]].
- **You can learn a new specialty during a [[Downtime and Travel|downtime skip]] of one or more _years_**, so long as you can find an appropriate mentor, course, or school.
- **Your [[Facilitator|FC]] can also award you with a new specialty at any time** _if they think you've done enough during the course of a campaign to earn it_. (Though this is usually done during a [[Development Sessions|development session]] as a reward for keeping a [[Habits|Habit]] for long enough).

### Inventing New Specialties

Specialties are just words — usually pluralized nouns, proper nouns, or short evocative phrases — with brief explanations attached to them in the [[Specialties List|specialties list]] to remind you what they mean.

**Making up new specialties is quite easy:**

1. Identify something that you think is missing in the list, or identify something specific to your setting or character that you'd like to represent with a specialty.
2. Think of how it would be actively used: What sort of rolls it could be KISSed with, or what kinds of  facts it could establish, or something else of interest?
3. _Optionally:_ Think of a fun little passive use that mostly adds flavor, rather than anything that adds new mechanics or requires you to do any extra bookkeeping.
4. Check with your [[Peers]] that it's okay, and then write it down.

**Alternatively:** If you want something a little 'crunchier' then adding to the [[Gambits List]] might be a better idea instead, but this requires more governance from your [[Facilitator|FC]].
