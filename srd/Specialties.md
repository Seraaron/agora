# Specialties

Specialties can represent a great range of things: Fields of study, disciplines, or subjects of particular interest to you; specialist training you've received; hobbies; places or people you're overly-familiar with; languages or histories you've learned; traits or talents that aid you in your work; or, just a certain aptitude or working knowledge you've garnered over time.

> #### Using Specialties
>
> **Once per session, each specialty can be _actively used_ in one of three ways:**
>
> - **[[KISSing|KISS]] a die to re-roll it** while performing a relevant [[Tasks|Task]].
> - **[[#Establishing Facts|Establish a fact]] about the topic** by making an appropriate [[Checks|Check]].
> - **Automatically succeed any related [[Checks|Check]]**, _instead of using [[Ego]]_.
>
> Once a specialty has been used in one of the ways above, put a light ╳ mark through the circle symbol next to it on your [character sheet](#charsheet) (eg. ❍ → $\xcancel{❍}$); and at the end of the session you can erase all the ╳s, so you're fresh for next time.

## Fact Checks

This is a way to let you remember things your character should already know in relation to the specialty, _using a Resolve check_, or to discover new information about the topic, _using a Wits check_; we call this process 'establishing a fact'.

The difficulty of the Fact check depends on the obscurity of the information:

- **Easy check:** Common knowledge.
- **Normal check:** Obscure knowledge.
- **Hard check:** Secret knowledge (or _plot-convenient knowledge_).

> #eg
> #unfinished

This requires input and cooperation from your [[Peers]], but enables you to do some light collaborative world-building while at the table; suggesting ideas and seeing if fate agrees with you.

In some instances, your [[Facilitator]] may veto these ideas and disallow the Check, but only if they would contradict other pre-planned bits of information. However, in some cases, **the FC can offer pre-written information to you on a successful Fact check instead**.

> #nb
> If the Check fails then the FC may simply say that you don't remember clearly, or they may _subvert the fact_ taking your idea and flipping it on its head somehow, or they may say your character thinks that it's one way when really it's another way (letting the dramatic irony hang); or perhaps they may use some combination of all the above.

#imp When new facts are esablished or discovered, it's a good idea to _write them down_ and [[Taking notes|take notes]].

## Passive Uses

A specialty can also inform you that your character is proficient, capable, and comfortable with the thing in question, _without the need for a roll;_ which may allow you to do things which wouldn't otherwise be possible, or prevent you from being penalized. *This is similar to how [[Habits#Habits are Versatile|certain habits]] can work. *

> #eg
> The 'Literacy' specialty lets you read and write in your native language, and in any other languages that you have a specialty in ([[#Using language Specialties|see below]]).

#que _These 'passive uses' are always available to you_, even once the specialty has exhausted its active use for the session.

## [generic] Specialties

When you see a generic noun listed as a specialty in lower-case between square-brackets '[like this]', then you should place a proper noun or an adjective specific to that specialty, identifying it, before the word in the square brackets when you add it your character sheet. Examples are usually offered in the [[Specialties List]].

> #eg
> The specialty '[city]' should become 'London city' when you add it to your sheet if your character lived or worked in or around London when they acquired that specialty, rather than interpreting it to mean a specialty for _any_ city.

###### Using [language] Specialties

Languages have a special use case: As with any generic specialty, a '[language]' specialty should turn into a named language of your choice:

> #eg
> Such as 'English language', 'Malay language', or 'Swahili language', or whatever setting-appropriate language you like, such as 'Goblin language' or 'Toki Pona language'.

Having a [language] specialty passively informs us that you can speak that language with passing accuracy (and read and write in it fairly well too, if you also have the 'Literacy' specialty), [[When to roll dice|without a roll]].

But instead of being used to [[#Fact Checks|establish facts]], language specialties can be used with an Appeal [[Checks|Check]] to 'find the right words' _to express yourself for a scene without risk of being misunderstood_. The difficulty of the Check, then, depends on the complexity of the ideas you're trying to express.

#que This _example case_, using languages, should serve as a model for how you might use other specialties in combination with a Check too.

## Learning new Specialties

Beyond [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] there are two main ways to learn new specialties:

- During downtime, **you can learn one new specialty per in-game season**, so long as you can find an appropriate mentor or trainer.
- During [[Development sessions|development sessions]] you can talk with your Peers about your current specialties and which ones are working or not working for you, and then **vote to change or replace them**.

> #nb
> Your [[Facilitator|FC]] can also award you with a new specialty _if they think you've done enough during the course of a campaign to earn it_. This is either also done during development sessions, or occasionally as a reward for completing a [[Principles#Goals|goal]].

### Inventing new Specialties

Specialties are just words — usually pluralized nouns, proper nouns, or short evocative phrases — with brief explanations attached to them in the [[Specialties List]] to remind you what they mean.

Making up new specialties is quite easy: Just identify something that you think is missing in the [[Specialties List]], or identify something specific to your setting or character that you'd like to represent with a specialty, and write it down.
