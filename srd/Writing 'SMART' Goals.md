#### Writing 'SMART' Goals

By writing ‘**Specific**, **Motivating**, **Achievable**, **Relevant** and **Testable**’ Goals, you provide yourself with a target to aim for a pathway to get there:

- **Specific:** Target something to improve or change in your character's life: be that something about their current situation, their [[Circumstances|circumstances]], local environment, or their wider society.

- **Motivating:** Make sure that this is something that you — _the player_ — are interested in doing too and think would be fun. There's no point in spending _literally hours of your life_ acting in a way that you don't really want to. If you lose motivation to complete a Goal at any point, then discuss it with your [[Peers]] and change it.

- **Achievable:** Ask your [[Facilitator|FC]] how realistic your Goal is, and whether they think it's a good idea? Because they will be the one who has to make [[Pitching and Planning*|plans]] to [[Challenging Principles|challenge]] it. Even _a Goal doomed to fail_ can be fun to play though, for the [dramatic irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Dramatic_irony), _and you still get rewarded for trying_.

- **Relevant:** Check that the Goal won't take you too far of course from your other principles, that it won't overly disrupt the campaign's current [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|theme]], and that it is likely to be something all your friends are going to enjoy seeing you try to accomplish too.

- **Testable:** Think about how long it will take to achieve, how you can track progress, what [[Jobs|jobs]], [[Specialties|specialties]] and [[Assets and Gear|assets or gear]] you'll likely use along the way, and how you will quantify success by the end.

❗ Some of this advice also applies to writing [[Habits]] and [[Creeds]].

> ### Nb.
>
> The **SMART** acronym was originally a business development [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) written by George T. Doran for _Management Review_ (c. 1981), but it can be adapted to writing principles in [[Agora]] too.

###### Use what works for you or your table

You don't have to follow this guide exactly, of course — and not every Goal will match all five criteria exactly — but SMART can be a _useful starting place_ if you're writing a new Goal, or if you're just new to the idea of writing your character's intentions out so explicitly like this in a game.

There are other mnemonic acronyms you could use instead or as well, like **CLEAR** (Collaborative, Limited, Emotional, Appreciable, and Refinable) or **PURE** (Positive, Understandable, Relevant, and Ethical), but that comes down to personal preference at that point.
