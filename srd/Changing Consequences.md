#### _Optional:_ Changing Consequences

[[Ego]] can be spent outside of rolls to influence the narrative in larger ways: Namely, to alter or delay a [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequence]] (usually from a previous scene or interaction) right as it's about to rear its head.

**This doesn't _entirely prevent_ the consequence from occurring**, it either _delays the inevitable_ or just _changes it out for something equally bad_. This can dramatically change the current situation in just about any way that your [[Facilitator|FC]] and [[Peers]] agree is appropriate, so feel free to experiment.
