### Only apply relevant Factors

'Relative' considerations, rather than 'absolute' ones. #unfinished

![[Generic Difficulty Factor Examples]]

#### Job-specific Factors

##### Arbitrary Difficulty Factors

Additionally, if the FC wants to make a roll more difficult, for whatever reason, but _can't point to a specific factor_ then [[FC Principles and Kismet|they can spend a Lot]] to count another factor (again, up to the _five factors maximum_).

### Getting a 'Sense of Difficulty'

It may be useful to consider how difficulty a Task may be based on how many factors it has, using a combination of _heuristics and statistics_.

First lets think about what it should _feel like_ to have to overcome a certain number of factors:

1.  **Simple** — you're _almost guaranteed_ to get what you want (equivalent to an 'easy' check with 3 dice)
2.  **Fair** — about a fifty-fifty shot even for adepts (equivalent to a 'normal' check with 3 dice)
3.  **Tough** — the upper limit of expected success for most people's raw job level (equivalent to a 'hard' check with 3 dice)
4.  **Challenging** — may need to KISS a die or two or get lucky with 6s and spend Ego
5.  **Ambitious** — would probably need help, assets, or other bonus dice to make up the difference
6.  **Absurd** — generally requires all of the bonus dice you can find _and_ some lucky KISSes

Next, you may want to consider the following table, which describes how likely you are to succeed at a roll with 1-6 factors, using 1-6 **rank 5** dice (without KISSing):

| Factors vs Dice |   1D  |   2D  |   3D  |   4D  |   5D  |   6D  |
| --------------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|        1 Factor | 33.3% | 55.6% | 70.4% | 80.2% | 86.8% | 91.2% |
|       2 Factors |   —   | 11.1% | 25.9% | 40.7% | 53.9% | 64.9% |
|       3 Factors |   —   |   —   | 3.70% | 11.1% | 21.0% | 32.0% |
|       4 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   | 1.23% | 4.53% | 10.0% |
|       5 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   | 0.41% | 1.78% |
|       6 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   | 0.14% |

More tables and stats like this can be found in the '[[Dice Probabilities and Statistics]]' appendix.
