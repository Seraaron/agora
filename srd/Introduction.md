[[Agora]] is a tabletop roleplaying game that heavily focuses on complex narratives and rich character development. Its [[Agenda|agenda-driven]] design means that the [[Player Characters|player's character's]] are always seeking to improve their lot in life, overcoming external adversity, or experiencing some kind of change. This is represented using hand-written [[Principles|principles]], and rewarded at the end of each session with a currency called '[[Kismet|kismet]]' — _your share in destiny!_

Agora uses a pool-based D6 system to resolve conflicts, but there are two main types of roll you can make:

- [[Checks]], which are quite simple and fast, and represent only your raw talent and luck.
- [[Tasks]], which are slower and more methodical, and represent your training and skill.

Both types of roll can be '[[KISSing|KISSed]]', which is a method of drawing on addition bonuses, to re-roll your dice and try again to shoot for success. All actions have consequences in Agora, so great must be care taken to ensure that no dice are rolled unnecessarily — _for once the dice hit the table, your Fate may be sealed._

This is a **free to play** product, currently in active development. 'Agora Fantasia' will be the name of the paid and physical release, once it's ready, but 'Agora' itself will always be free. If you end up trying out the game for yourself then please consider giving some feedback on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JwM6zBszKr).

### Inspirations

Agora takes inspiration _first and foremost_ from real-world history, folklore, and mythology, but it's also influenced by other tabletop games and video games, including Burning Wheel, Exalted, Final Fantasy, and The Elder Scrolls. _For example, Agora uses a flexible [[Jobs|Job System]] — instead of traditional 'classes' and 'skills' — that are individually leveled, and which don't lock-off character progression options._

###### Questions, Notes, & Clarifications

Throughout the articles you will notice occasional big red question marks and exclamation points. These are like sidenotes, which give additional information to the reader, and are usually no longer than a single sentence:

> ### Ie.

> ❓ Big question marks provide an answer to an anticipated question you may have immediately after reading a rule above.
>
> ❗ Big exclamation points tell you important things to note, remind you of other related rules, or give warnings about misuse.

Sidebars, such as this one, are also where I — the designer — talk to you _more directly_ and either explain why I designed a mechanic in a certain way, offer some advice to help [[Facilitator|Facilitators]] with [[Quick Session Plan|running the game and moderating play]], or make suggestions for alternative rules interpretations.

### What Does 'Agora' Mean?

Literally translating to "gathering place" or "assembly", an [agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora) was a central public space in many ancient Greek city-states. It was an open forum, where social and political quorum could be reached. In other words, the agora was the center of the athletic, artistic, business, social, spiritual and political life in the city.

**[[Agora]], the game**, is about all of these things — _athletics, arts, business, society, religion, and politics_ — if you want it to be. It's a generic system, and this wiki serves as its standard reference document (or 'SRD'). But the name also reflects the open and communal values of the game itself, in two additional ways:

- Via the [[Peers]] and [[Facilitator]] player roles — rather than a traditional 'Game Master' — which aid in playing the game more collaboratively.
- Via the free [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license](https:/creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which we use to allow anyone to make content for this game and profit from their work, so long as they refer back to Agora properly and give appropriate credit to [Seraaron](https://twitter.com/SeraaronArt) and anyone else that helped them.

❗ More details and resources on how to do this are offered in the [[Guides for being an 'Agora-like' game*]] article.
