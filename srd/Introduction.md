###### Questions, Notes, & Clarifications

Throughout the articles you will notice occasional big red question marks, exclamation points, and asterisks. These are like sidenotes, which give additional information to the reader, and are usually no longer than a single sentence:

> ### Ie.
>
> ❓ Big question marks provide an answer to an anticipated question you may have immediately after reading a rule above.
>
> ❗ Big exclamation points tell you important things to note, remind you of other related rules, or give warnings about misuse.

**Note:** Sidebars — such as this one — are also where I talk to you _more directly_ and either explain why I designed a mechanic in a certain way, offer some advice to help Facilitators with [[Quick Session Plan|running the game and moderating play]], or make suggestions for alternative rules interpretations.

###### What does 'agora' mean?

Literally translating to "gathering place" or "assembly", an [agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora) was a central public space in many ancient Greek city-states. It was an open forum, where social and political quorum could be reached. In other words, the agora was the center of the athletic, artistic, business, social, spiritual and political life in the city.

**[[Agora]], the game**, is about all of these things — _athletics, arts, business, society, religion, and politics_ — if you want it to be. It's a generic system, and this wiki serves as its standard reference document (or 'SRD'). But the name also reflects the open and communal values of the game itself, in two additional ways:

- Via the [[Peers]] and [[Facilitator]] player roles — rather than a traditional 'Game Master' — which aid in playing the game more collaboratively.
- Via the free [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license](https:/creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which we use to allow anyone to make content for this game and profit from their work, so long as they refer back to Agora properly and give appropriate credit to [Seraaron](https://twitter.com/SeraaronArt) and anyone else that helped them.
