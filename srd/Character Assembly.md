# Character Assembly

Character assembly is the process of making a [[Player Characters|Playable Character]]: Your avatar that you control and perform as during play. Character assembly is a fun activity, and almost a game onto itself, but it's important to do it together with your friends so you all make compatible characters for the scenario or the campaign.

If you're unable to make characters together, for whatever reason, then be sure to [[Peers#How to use your Peers|review]] each other's character sheets before you begin playing.

## 1. Concept Concept Concept

The first and most important step is to think of a character concept. A good concept is a single sentence that sums them up, a reference to another character from popular culture, or an image that you're using for inspiration which conveys more than your words can.

A concept _doesn't have to be perfect_ — or it doesn't matter if your [[Peers]] don't get the reference — as you'll refine them more as you go through the assembly process, and make them distinctly yours. A concept may include a bit of backstory, key features, or some 'proto-principles', but try to keep it short and sweet and setting-appropriate.

> ### Eg.
>
> -   An ambitious noblewoman, intent on rallying the people of the city to his side and publicly humiliating the aristocrats and pundits who said it couldn't be done.
> -   Like a cross between Robin Hood and Don Quixote; someone who wants to stealing from the rich and give to the poor, but he's completely incompetent.
> -   An adopted child, ferried to a distant land, who's now building a mercenary company with the aid of some friends and other adventurers.

So long as the character is clear to you — and your Peers _mostly_ get where you're going with it, and can see their own character concepts working in tandem with yours — then you should be okay to proceed.

## 2. Assembly Method

There are two main methods for fleshing-out your concept into a [[Player Characters|PC]], and which method you choose depends on how much time you have and how flexible you want your characters to be:

-   **[[#Using Flatpacks]]:**
    -   This is where you choose an archetype or template, from a list of options called 'flatpacks', that best suit your character concept.
    -   The flatpack you choose has all of the information you need to build a character of that type, presenting options in sections, and ultimately giving you a well-rounded character with a few customizations.
    -   _This method is recommended for beginner players and simple characters_.
-   **[[#Creation from Scratch]]:**
    -   This is where there are much fewer restrictions about what choices you can make, and you will have to choose your stats and features from the [[Agora#§ 5 — Lists|individual lists]].
    -   You are given 80 additional 'caps' — character assembly points — and let loose to buy whatever you want with them, which can give you a fairly imbalanced character if you're not careful.
    -   _This method is recommended for experienced players or complex characters_.

## Using Flatpacks

The flatpacks (or 'FPs' for short) that you can choose depend on your [[Tier]]. When you use a flatpack, most of the creative heavy lifting — the conceptualization and number-crunching — has already been done for you; leaving you with a few options to fill out and some customizations to add.

## Creation from Scratch

Creating a character from scratch is more difficult than using a flatpack because it requires you to have a fairly good understanding of the system and the options available to you. *You may also need to use a calculator or spreadsheet to keep track of your spending before you finalize any choices*.

**You're given 80 'caps'** — character assembly points — when you make a character from scratch, in addition to any [[Tier#Tier Benefits|bonus caps]] from your [[Tier]], and **you are trusted to spend them on whatever you like**, using the menu below.

Thus, the only real restrictions placed on you when building from scratch are based on your character's tier, and the inherent limits of the character sheet. However, **any character made from scratch must be reviewed and approved by your [[Peers]] before you can play them**, using a [[Peers#Peer Votes|vote]] if necessary.
