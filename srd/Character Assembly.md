# Character Assembly

**Character assembly is the step-by-step process of making a [[Player Characters|Playable Character]]:** Your avatar that you control and perform as during play. Character assembly is a fun activity, and _almost a game onto itself_, but it's important to do it together with your friends so you all make compatible characters for the scenario or the campaign.

❗ **If you're unable to make characters together, for whatever reason, then be sure to [[Peers#How to use your Peers|review]] each other's character sheets before you begin playing.**

![[Character Assembly Summary]]

## 1. Concept Concept Concept

The first and most important step is to think of a character concept. A good concept is a single sentence that sums them up, a reference to another character from popular culture, or an image that you're using for inspiration which conveys more than your words can.

A concept _doesn't have to be perfect_ — or it doesn't matter if your [[Peers]] don't get the reference — as you'll refine them more as you go through the assembly process, and make them distinctly yours. A concept may include a bit of backstory, key features, or some 'proto-principles', but try to keep it short and sweet and setting-appropriate.

> ### Eg.
>
> - An ambitious noblewoman, intent on rallying the people of the city to his side and publicly humiliating the aristocrats and pundits who said it couldn't be done.
> - Like a cross between Robin Hood and Don Quixote — someone who wants to stealing from the rich and give to the poor, but he's completely incompetent.
> - An adopted child, ferried to a distant land by a noble family, who's now building a mercenary company with the aid of some friends and other adventurers.

So long as the character is clear to you — and your Peers _mostly_ get where you're going with it, and can see their own character concepts working in tandem with yours — then you should be okay to proceed.

![[Tier]]

### The Two Arrays

**There are two [[Rank|ability rank]] arrays available for each Tier:** A _balanced_ array (left) suitable for new players, or an _unbalanced_ array (right) suitable for advanced players. Both arrays sum to the same total, but the difference between them can sometimes be quite astounding.

❓ You don't have to finalize your assigned ability ranks until [[#5 The Finishing Touches|the penultimate step]] of character assembly, since your decision will be partially-informed by the [[Jobs|jobs]] you take, so feel free to come back to this later. Still, it's worth mentioning at this stage so you can start mulling them over.

## 2. Archetypes

Archetypes are handy pre-packaged groups of jobs and features that make a few assumptions and decisions _for you_ with the objective of speeding up the process of character creation. They provide a skeleton, of sorts, that should help you to mold your character concept around.

Which archetypes are available to you, which ones you will choose, and how important those decisions are will all depend on your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|genre, themes, and tone]] — so be sure to discuss it in [[Development Sessions|session zero]].

**Archetypes give your character the majority of their jobs and features, and they can't be changed once you begin playing, so choose carefully**.

After you've made your character you can almost ignore your archetypes entirely for the rest of the game, if you wish to — but they usually bring a bit of flavor, describe some implicit world-building, and help you to roleplay. They count as [[Circumstances|circumstances]] too, so they can earn you [[Lots]] and may be useful for making [[Links]] rolls.

❗ If an archetype doesn't give you a particular job or feature, for example, then that doesn't preclude you from purchasing it later on with _'[[#4 Character Assembly Points|caps]]'_.

❓ If an archetype doesn't _exactly_ match your concept, but gets you close enough, then you can easily re-name it or swap-out one or two of it's features for other ones, _with the permission of your [[Peers]]_.

### Choosing Archetypes:

There are three main lists to choose archetypes from: An **ancestry** or **species**, your **culture** or **origin**, and a **profession** or **vocation**.

**You must choose one from each list**, _or otherwise make up your own with the help of your [[Facilitator|FC]]_.

The structure of each archetype differs according to the list it belongs to, but in general they are each presented as a table of jobs, features, and other benefits for you to make selections from.

❓ The lists also all have rollable tables at the start, to make randomization easier if you'd prefer to go that route, or if you're struggling to think of a [[#1 Concept Concept Concept|concept]].

#### I. Ancestry / Species

**Chosen from the [[Ancestries List]].**

This represents your character's genetic makeup or physical substance — their core _taxonomic characteristics_ that determine their average [[Size|size]], expected lifespan, and general body shape. It is usually the thing that will affect the most about the way your character _looks_, and it can be an important roleplaying decision, but it **usually has the _least_ mechanical impact of all three archetype choices**.

##### Ancestral Benefits:

- Ancestries only define your **inherent [[Gambits|gambits]] and [[Conditions|conditions]]**.
- They grant no jobs or specialties, or any other features.

_Remember:_ **Your [[Jobs|jobs]] all start at level 1, and [[Rank|ability ranks]] are only advanced by your [[Tier]].** _This is true for all ancestries._

---

###### Human by Default

If you're not playing in a setting with any playable _sapient creatures_ besides 'human', then this isn't even a choice and it doesn't need to listed as an archetype. All characters in such a world simply gain a [[Gambits List#Commonplace Gambits|commonplace gambit]] of their choice, another free [[D666 Conditions|random condition]],  and a [[Specialties List|free specialty]] of their choice, _as per the description for [[Ancestries List#Human Benefits|human benefits]] in the [[Ancestries List]]_.

---

#### II. Culture / Origin

**Chosen from the [[Cultures List]].**

This predominately represents your character's ethnicity and heritage, but it can also refer to a new subculture or way of life that they've adopted over time. Cultural archetypes are divided mainly by their geographic points of origin — as the environment that a people develops in often strongly contributes to the lessons they teach one another — but some are based on societal differences too.

##### Cultural Benefits:

- Grants **+1 level to three [[Jobs|jobs]]**.
- **A random [[Specialties|specialty]]**, which you roll a d6 for, to choose from a list of six.
- And some _**additional benefits**_ which include:
	- **A set specialty**, and
	- _Either a small bonus to [[Wealth]], or an [[Assets and Gear|asset die]] relating to your culture's community_.

❓ When there is a slash / in a listed archetype, choose _only one_ of the available options. When you see specialties in [square brackets], remember that they are [[Specialties#Generic Specialties|generics]] and can be replaced with anything related to the given noun.

> ### Nb.
>
> Cultural archetypes can be used to quickly define — in broad strokes — language, religion, food, fashion, knowledge, music, and traditions for a character (or group of characters). It's important to not be too reductive when doing this though. Try to breath some life and personality into the cold stats and generic names at the same time as choosing cultures.

#### III. Profession / Vocation

**Chosen from the [[Professions List]].**

This represents the most recent career path that your character has pursued, or just the things that they've discovered they're best at over time (if that doesn't fit neatly into a traditional 'occupation'). The list of professional archetypes are divided up by the [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|game themes]] they best suit: From high adventure, to politics and intrigue, to military fiction, pulp horror and crime noir, or something more pastoral or soapy.

❗ It is usually better to all play as characters with professions that serve the same theme, but _if your [[Peers]] agree_ then you can choose a profession from different groups instead.

##### Professional Benefits:

- **Four 'Major Jobs' that are each raised by +3 levels**.
- **Four 'Minor Jobs' that are each raised by +1 level**.
- _**Plus:**_
	- Some free [[Assets and Gear|asset dice or gear]].
	- Up to three additional [[Specialties|specialties]].
	- A bonus to your [[Wealth]] rating.
- **Two basic grade [[Gambits|gambits]]**, or one _advanced_ grade gambit.

##### Major / Minor

Finally, you can choose _two more_ Major jobs (+3 levels) and _two more_ Minor jobs (+1 level) from from the full [[Jobs List]], for a total of five of each.

**These jobs cannot overlap with the selections that have already been made by your choice of profession**. _You can't list a single job as both Major and Minor to gain +4 levels, for example._

❗ You may _however_ swap out a single Major job for a Minor one, and _vice versa_, to create some additional variety or customization.

❓ All other jobs (starting at level 1) are considered 'Miscellaneous' by comparison. You can still level them up later, but you'll have to do it using '[[#4 Character Assembly Points|caps]]' or through play.

---

###### Complete Customization

If you decide to forego the selection of archetypes entirely, then the breakdown goes like this. All characters should finish step 2 with:

- 6 Major jobs (+3 Lv. each),
- 6 Minor jobs (+1 Lv. each),
	- And +1 level to 3 more jobs (not counted as 'minor jobs'),
	- This should give a total of +27 levels.
	- Though no job should be higher than level 5, at this stage.
- A selection of assets and gear.
- 2-3 Gambits (basic grade).
- 5-6 Specialties.
- 1-6 Wealth.

---

## 3. Random Elements

As a part of life, there are few things that seem uncontrollable — things left to Fate. These are represented while making a character via rollable tables. You will have already encountered some optional rolls while choosing archetypes, but now you can inject even more random chance into the creation process.

This comes in the form of a few rolls on the [[D66 Jobs|common jobs table]] and one or two rolls on the [[D666 Conditions|conditions table]].

### Common Jobs

Roll a D66 on the table below to gain **+1 level** in a random [[Jobs|job]], _for free_. This represents a common set of skills that a person could tangentially pick up during their lifetime, in almost any setting.

![[D66 Jobs]]

Roll (or choose) as many times as indicated by your character's [[Age|age]]. **If you roll the same common job twice then roll or choose again. Each common job you take must be different from each other.**

❗ Also, no job should be higher than level 5, at this stage.

❓ The common jobs you take don't have to perfectly suit your character's [[#1 Concept Concept Concept|core concept]]. You can think of them as your character's 'hobbies', or they can be used to _implicitly reveal something about their past_.

### Common Conditions

In addition to choosing random jobs, you can also choose some random [[Conditions|conditions]]. **All characters can roll _up to two_ [[D666 Conditions|common conditions]]**, _for free_, and [[Ancestries List#Humans|humans]] can roll _thrice_. This is done using a D666.

**See:** [[D666 Conditions]] for full list.

Because [[Conditions|conditions]] are a little more personal than jobs, if the rolls don't gel with your character [[Character Assembly#1 Concept Concept Concept|concept]] then we recommend either reading through the list for one that does, or _[[Conditions#Making New Conditions|making up new conditions]] entirely_.

Then again, it can be fun to stick with the hand you've been dealt and see it through! **Even if they can produce unexpected result, these rolls can be used to tell us a little bit about your character's backstory.**

## 4. Character Assembly Points

This is the part where you can _really start to customize your character_, when the constraints are removed, and you can fill in the important pieces you need to make your character _yours_.

You're given a certain number of 'character assembly points' — or 'caps', for short — **first based on your [[Tier]]** and then _a bonus is granted by your [[Wealth]] rating multiplied by 3_.

![[Tier Benefits]]

### Spending Caps

Caps can be used to buy almost anything — according to the [[Caps Menu|caps menu]] — except for a higher tier, additional archetypes, better ability ranks, or more wealth.

![[Caps Menu]]

❗ You may need to use a calculator to keep track of the running-total of cap costs, or a digital spreadsheet is provided in the [[Character Resources]] article.

#### Refunds

With your [[Facilitator|FC's]] permission you may also _'sell'_ any of the benefits granted by your archetype choices to buy other things that better suit your character concept. **Though this is not recommended for beginner players.**

❓ The only things you can't sell are major, minor, or common job levels, and any inherited gambits or conditions.

#### Left Overs

**Any spare caps remaining at the end of this step are destroyed**, so consider buying some [[Gear List#Cash-Money|cash]] if you have a few floating caps that you don't know what else to do with. Otherwise, you can _intentionally handicap yourself_ by not spending all the caps you've been granted.

## 5. The Finishing Touches

Once you have no caps left, there's still a few things to do before the character is ready to play. These are easier to do away from the table, outside of a [[Development Sessions|development session]], so feel free to think about them over the course of the week.

### A. Ability Ranks

If you haven't already, you need to finalize your [[Rank|ability ranks]]. You must choose a spread of ranks according to your [[Tier|tier]]: The 'balanced' (left) or 'unbalanced' (right) [[#The Two Arrays|array]].

**One rank from each set must be assigned to an [[Abilities|ability]]** in any order you like, so long as the total sum is the same. _There are six numbers to arrange and six abilities to fill_.

It is best to do this now — after discovering all your other numbers — because now you have a clearer view of your whole character sheet and how the different parts relate to one another. _Abilities are the glue between all the other mechanics in this game_.

#### Capabilities

[[Capabilities]] are _optional abilities_ that can do a lot to set the [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|tone]] of a campaign. **There are three capability 'slots' on your character sheet, but four to choose from:**

- **[[Grit]]** — *Your mettle, quick decision making skills or survival instincts, and your ability to withstand the horrors of war.
	- [[Grit#Grit Questions|Grit questions]]
- **[[Honor]]** — _Your social standing, adherence to personal oaths or religious vows, and your ability to abide the codes of your culture._
	- [[Honor#Honor Questions|Honor questions]]
	- [[Shame]]
- **[[Links]]** — _Your memorability, sense of community or connection to others, and your ability to find the right people when you need them._
	- [[Links#Deriving Links|Links questions]]
- **[[Vigilance*]]** — _Your spirit, your perception of the weird or fantastical, and your ability to resist the effects of volatile magic._
	- [[Vigilance*#Deriving Vigilance|Vigilance questions]]
	- [[Torpor*]]
- Or you don't have to choose any, or you can [[Capabilities#Custom Capabilities|make up your own]].

When you add a capability to your sheet, _be sure to also write its associated [[Stress|stress]] on the line below the name_, and then **answer each capability's questionnaire with your [[Facilitator|FC]] to determine its starting rank**.

### B. Circumstances

[[Circumstances]] help to fill in the missing flavors of your character. They are an opportunity both for you to express yourself, and for you to highlight aspects that you want to be front-and-center — via '[[Circumstances#Foreground Traits|foregrounding]]' — or out-of-sight — via '[[Circumstances#Background Traits|backgrounding]]'.

**You can write almost anything you want here**, as a word, or a phrase; and you can encapsulate as much or as little meaning into those words as you like. This freedom can sometimes be as intimidating as a blank canvas though, so if you're struggling to find some interesting words, just start by getting into your character's head and thinking about _how they'd describe themselves_.

❓ More advice for writing circumstances is given in the [[Circumstances|full article]].

![[Bonding and Backstory Questions*]]

### C. Kith & Kin

Kith and Kin are [[VINPCs]] that you've met, or created, and marked as being 'essential' to the campaign. **These are either important people to the world at large, or important people to your character _personally_**.

The _kind of relationship_ you have with each VINPC — normal friendship, heated rivalry, forbidden romance, professional association, etc. —  is also up to you and your [[Facilitator|FC]], so make sure you discuss them together.

❓ You can list up to three VINPCs on your character sheet at any one time. But you don't have to fill these slots straight away if you don't want to, or if you can't think of anyone. It may be you find someone more important through play.

#### Starting Favor

Make an Appeal [[Checks|check]] for each character you've listed as kith or kin **to see if you start with their [[VINPCs#Favor|favor]] or not** (requiring 2 successes). If you _don't_ have their favor, then think about _'why not?'_ and tell your FC or [[Taking notes|write it down]].

### D. Principles

**Principles are how you motivate your character to act**, they can dictate the [[Agenda|agendas]] you pursue, and they are the primary way that you refresh and refill your [[Kismet|kismet]]. _They are the mode by which you strive to change the world_.

Each principle is hand-written — bespoke to your character and the situation at hand — each a single sentence. There are three types of principle — [[Goals]], [[Habits]], and [[Creeds]] — and six spaces to write them.

**Your principles should all either related to the [[setting and situation]] that your campaign is built on, the [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*]] of the game at large, or your answers to the [[#Bonding & Backstory Questions]] (above).**

❓ If you're struggling to write your principles then try using the '[[Writing 'SMART' Goals|SMART]]' mnemonic: Specific, Motivating, Achievable, Relevant, and Testable.

❗ Failing that, some [[example principles]] are also provided with blank spaces for you to edit or fill in as desired.

#### Starting Kismet

**All characters start with: 2 [[Lots]], 1 [[Ego]], 0 [[Fidelity]], and 2 [[Health]].**

The only exceptions are, _with your [[Facilitator|FCs]] permission:_

- If you choose to start without Ego, take another +1d6 Lots.
- If you choose to start with 1 Health, take +1 Fidelity and a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]].
- If you are an [[Age|junior or senior]] character, you only have 1 Health (max).

❓ If you want to have a harder early game experience, then start with no Lots or Ego.

## 6. Save!

Once you've done all this hard work, don't forget to save, take a photo of your character sheet, or otherwise make a backup. _You'll kick yourself later if you don't have one and end up needing it._

Now, all that's left to do is to **get excited to play**!
