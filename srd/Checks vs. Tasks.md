# Checks & Tasks

Once your [[Agenda|agenda has been discussed]] with your [[Peers]], and it's clear that a roll actually [[When to roll dice|needs to be made]], your [[Facilitator]] will determine what kind of roll this will be — a **[[Checks|Check]]** or a **[[Tasks|Task]]**?

## When to use a Check or a Task?

They both use the same rules for counting successes based on [[Rank|ability rank]], but they ultimately resolve a little differently:

-   **[[Checks]] are generally quicker** — taking less than a minute of real life play time — because they use only a few dice, and there are only three difficulties (easy, normal, or hard).
	-   They're mostly used to try to complete _basic actions using simple verbs_, relying only on your raw abilities and sheer luck.
	-   They have two main possible outcomes: _Success or Failure_ ('pass' or 'miss').

-   **[[Tasks]] take a bit longer** — sometimes taking up to ten minutes of real time — because there's usually more discussion beforehand.
	-   They draw dice from a [[Jobs|job's level]] and other bonuses, and build up the difficulty out of multiple _[[Tasks#Set the Difficulty Factors|relative difficulty factors]]_.
	-   They can be used to achieve multiple objectives at once, or to achieve singular objectives on a much larger scale, but that also means they usually have more complex and nuanced outcomes.

Checks are great to use when the only obstacle between success and failure is their own abilities, and they generally fill in the beats of most [[Session Structure#Scenes|scenes]]. _Tasks exist to accommodate the more complicated moments of play,_ and will chance the pace of a scene when you use them.

### Facilitator Styles

It is ultimately your [[Facilitator|FC's]] decision whether to use a Check or a Task — or whether to just [[When to roll dice|say 'yes']] — for any given roll; and while the one they choose should mostly depend on the context of the current action, it can also depend the campaign's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]], or simply on their preferred [[Player Characters#Player Styles|play style]].

Tasks often produce far more interesting results than Checks. You could theoretically _run the game using only Tasks_, but you'll probably have a much bumpier ride if you do: **If Tasks are the wheels of this game, then Checks are the suspension — smoothing out the experience of play**.

Checks are also vastly more useful during high-octane scenes, where you want to pass the narrative beats around quickly, especially while exploring or fighting with a whole group of characters. Games with less direct adventure and more political intrigue may end up using more Tasks to persuade and cajole others, or to have a duel against a single opponent. But most games will use a good mix of the two, or else find that the ratio drifts from session to session.
