#### High Fashion

The clothes you wear can sometimes matter quite a lot, especially in intrigue-focused and political games, or in sessions with a lot of social interaction with aristocratic factions. Wearing the latest fashion may grant bonus dice to certain rolls, similar to any other [[Assets and Gear|assets]], at the discretion of your [[Facilitator|FC]].

Making such items requires a [[Clothier]] roll (with [[Appeal]]), where **the base difficulty of the roll is equal to _twice the value of the dice rating_ you wish the item would grant, then +1 for each additional tag, plus any [[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]]**. This takes a number of weeks equal to the final difficulty.

#fashionable clothing then **grants one fewer die each subsequent time it is worn**, until it's die rating is worthless — _equivalent to normal clothes_.

**Note:** If you just want to craft simple armor — such as cloaks, padded leather, or head-wraps — then please refer to the [[Crafting|crafting]], but use [[Clothier]] instead.
