#### Building

When you want to build a large structure — such as a house, bridge, fort, or ship — first consider the size of the project and the variety of materials required to make it. This will give you a base difficulty and the approximate time taken to make the roll, which also creates [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]] for the other players, as follows:

| Project                            | Base Difficulty | _Time per Roll_ |
| ---------------------------------- | :-------------: | --------------- |
| House / Office / Barn / Wall       |        1        | _3 months_      |
| Road / Boat / Normal Bridge        |        2        | _6 months_      |
| Church / Temple / Canal            |        3        | _9 months_      |
| Fort / Ship / Prison / Aqueduct    |        4        | _1 year_        |
| Castle / Manor / Suspension Bridge |        5        | _2 years_       |
| Palace / Cathedral / Tanker        |        6        | _5 years_       |
| Pyramid / Skyscraper  / Great Work |        7        | _10 years_      |

You must acquire the right materials, workforce, and the permission to build, separately — which are processes that may take several prior rolls in their own right, and may cost a lot of money.

##### Specific Factors

Add any specific factors, or [[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]], to the base difficulty:

- “Building multiples at once...? (_+1 factor per copy_)
- “The design style demands great embellishment, high attention to detail, or rare materials...? (_increases worth but not functionality_)
- “The structure has more than three habitable stories, or stretches out longer than a mile horizontally...?

##### Methods & Technology

Finally consider the technology and methods you're able utilize in the construction process, to determine a difficulty multiplier.

| Age of Technology | Difficulty Multiplier | _Approx. European Equivalent_ |
| ----------------: | :-------------------: | ----------------------------- |
|             Stone |           ×7          | _< 3000 BCE_                  |
|            Bronze |           ×6          | _3000 — 1000 BCE_             |
|              Iron |           ×5          | _1000 BCE — 1000 CE_          |
|          Medieval |           ×4          | _1000 — 1600 CE_              |
|        Industrial |           ×3          | _1600 — 1900 CE_              |
|            Modern |           ×2          | _1900 CE — Present_           |
|            Future |           ×1          | _> 2050 CE_                   |

Multiply this by the sum of the base difficulty and the factors to give a total difficulty:

$$
Total = (Base + Factors) \times Multiplier
$$

#question If you're using #high-tech or #magic, then your dice on each roll can [[Exploding Dice|explode]].

##### Splitting the Roll

This calculation will very likely give you a final difficulty that is much higher than seems possible to achieve, and that's why you can split the roll up into smaller pieces and perform them over time. Each roll takes the same amount of time though, so the amount of times you split it up increases the total duration of the construction by that much.

> ### Eg.
> _You could split an iron age road-building project with one extra factor for its length $\left( total = (2 + 1) × 5 = 15 \right)$ into three rolls, each of difficulty 5, but the project would now take a year and half to complete (6 months ×3)._

##### Evaluating Failure

Failure on a roll either means that that portion of  the construction must be re-done — taking more time and money, proportional to your margin of failure — or that that part is structurally unsound — weak to an attack, natural disaster, or accident — but complete.

##### Helping Hands

This process assumes that you have enough workers to suit the scope of the project. If you don't, then building anything larger than a house by yourself is practically impossible. Workers therefore, do not [[Helping|help]] in the normal sense — that is, they don't give you [[KISSing|KISSes]] — instead they will proportionally expedite the process.

> ### Ie.
> _If you have double the workers then each roll takes half as long; three times the workers equals a one-third reduction in time; four times gives a quarter; five times is a fifth; and so on._

The more helping hands, the more the cost of the project increases though. The specific details of this cost is left open for you to discuss and come to a consensus on _as [[Peers]]_, since such cases will be quite rare and highly dependent on the details of the project itself.

**Note:** If you just want to craft smaller objects — such as shields, carts, or boats — then please refer to the [[Crafting|crafting]] rules, but use [[Wright]] instead.
