#### Using Guns

Guns will _ignore non-bullet-proof shields_ during combat, making them very powerful, but earlier models were also much slower to reload. To the point where you likely wouldn't get able to get off more than one or two shots per battle before needing to switch to a sidearm. As firearms technology improved guns became safer, faster, and more efficient for the gunslinger (and more deadly for their targets).

Outside of combat, a direct hit from a gun can kill someone in seconds â€” so it's important to always describe non-pacifying hits from guns during combat as near hits or non-vital hits.

#important Always talk with your [[Peers]] before including guns in your game as it may be sensitive issue for some players, and they can drastically change the feel and [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]] of your setting.

##### Later Era Firearms

If you want to put fully mechanized firearms into your game, the best option is to _re-scale_ all the guns in the lists above. Rename them, and remove most of their #one-shot or #reload tags to represent larger magazine sizes (which also makes them cheaper). Then the superior quality versions of the same guns with the #auto tag would function more like modern equivalents.

Broadly speaking, the damages types of generic firearms can be categorized as follows:

| Firearm Family | Range Tag | Damage Tag |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Pistols:       | #short    | #slashing  |
| Rifles:        | #long     | #piercing  |
| Shotguns:      | #short    | #bashing   |
| Machine Guns:  | #long     | #rending   |

Rubber bullets would use the #binding tag, and if you're playing in a _futuristic setting_ them some guns may use the **special damage tags**: #freezing #crushing #burning #lightning
