# Social Discourse

When a discussion is turning into an argument, and **your difference of opinions can't be settled by agreeing to disagree**; when you know deep down that the other's theory is wrong, and that you need to prove that your theory is right; or when you're standing in court, on trial, or defending another; or simply having a friendly debate; _this is when discourse begins._

Social discourses are most often utilized in games that feature political intrigue, melodrama, and court sessions, or frequent debates about morality and ethics. They can also be used in adventure games to settle group disputes or to decide where to go next. A discourse _isn't_ a shouting match, and if it devolves into that then your differences may be better settled with a [[Martial Combat|martial conflict]], or an [[Opposed Tasks|Opposed task]] instead.

Before you get into dropping facts or speaking from the heart, there's a little bit of bookeeping and set up to do first, to ensure that the debate runs smoothly for all the players:

- **Each speaker must first determine three things: [[#Premises]], [[#Presence]], and [[#Disposition]], in that order**.
- **The other important number to keep an eye on during the debate is [[#Momentum]]**, which governs how intense the argument is getting and how close anyone is to being easily dismissed.

> ### Nb.
>
> This system functions very similarly to [[Martial Combat|martial combat]], except using #social jobs instead of #martial ones. It can emulate anything from a private argument, to a public debate in front of a crowd, or it can be used to sway a neutral third party one way or another.

###### Multiple Speakers

It is not really possible to run a discourse with more than two main speakers, it will quickly get unwieldy if there are three or more sets of arguments to track. Hence it is better to either take sides and [[Interact|aid]] one another with every roll, or to break the topic into smaller sequential debates.

If you do have a few people on your side, then you can either take it in turns to speak (and therefore roll) while receiving [[Helping|help]] from your allies, or you can have one person do all the talking while the rest just grant the odd bonus dice and a slight increase to [[#Presence|Presence]].

‚ùó Everyone who enters the debate is tied to the consequences though.

---

## Premises

Your premise is a distillation of the core arguments you'll be making over the course of the debate into a single sentence. **It's _the side that you take_, so to speak, and _what you stand to gain_ if you win**. It's your position in the matter at hand, and the reason for whole argument in the first place.

Go around the table and let every character lay out their premise. This is a statement of intentions, and a setting of terms and conditions, and **should be treated in a similar way as an [[Agenda|agenda]]** ‚Äî except it's an agenda for the whole conflict, not just one roll. Once you're happy with it, _you should write your premise down to help you roleplay through the scene_.

‚ùì You may think of your premise as your 'starting position' on the matter, but it can drift over the course of the discourse too. The premise matters most when you come to [[Judge]], at the [[#Settling a Debate|end of the argument]].

### Bound by Words

Agreeing to the premises binds you to the consequences of the conflict to the same degree that any other [[Agenda#Actions and Objectives|action and objective]] would. So, if everyone agrees to the premises then the argument can continue. If someone doesn't agree, then they must either try to renegotiate the terms or refuse to participate and leave the scene.

‚ùó If two characters have the same (or similar) premises then they're considered to be on the same side, and if all characters already agree then there's no conflict.

## Presence

Presence represents _your projected self-confidence or reliance on status to protect you, combined with your general mental and social athleticism._ **Presence is the minimum difficulty for most offensive moves used against you in the conflict**. First let the [[Facilitator|FC]] describe where the debate is taking place, who the important speakers are, and what the general atmosphere is like, **then calculate your Presence as follows:**

$$
roundup \left( (highest(Charmer, Property) + Faction + 0..3) \div 2 \right) + Reputation
$$

That is:

- Start with the highest of:
	- Your **[[Charmer]] level**.
	- Your **property dice** (ie. if you're having the conversation on your property).
- Then add any **faction dice** (eg. your influence, position or power, social stature, etc.) if relevant, and some conditional benefits:
	- Add +1 _if you're the oldest speaker in the discourse?_
	- Add +1 _if a third party is present and known to already share your premise?_
	- Add +1 _if you are historic enemies, or have had a similar debate like this before?_
- Divide the total by 2 and round up!
- Finally, add a source of **reputation dice** (nb. if it's directly relevant).

Since you will need to quote this number to other players frequently, **write it down on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]]**, or somewhere easy to see. Presence is also _added_ to your starting [[#Disposition]], but it otherwise remains static.

‚ùì Property, faction influence, and reputations are all types of [[Assets and Gear|assets]].

### Alternative Presence Jobs?

If the debate is of a scientific or theological nature then you must use your [[Philosopher]] level to calculate Presence, instead of [[Charmer]]. If it's about finance or policy decisions then use [[Steward]]. If it's about warfare and tactics then use [[Commander]].

## Disposition

Disposition here represents _your patience and calmness of mind or your general ability to spot nonsense and drivel,  combined with your strength of character relative to the other speakers_. Disposition does three main things during the discourse:

- **It decides _the turn order_ (or 'initiative') for all speakers, from highest to lowest, which you can track using a [[momentumGrid.svg|grid of numbers]] and a token that represents your character. **
- **It is the amount of [[Momentum]] that is needed for an opponent to try to _[[Judge]] you with no major penalties_**.
- **If you hit zero Disposition during the debate then you must either sit down and concede, or excuse yourself from the scene, or else you may be automatically _dismissed_ by another character.**

### Roll Disposition!

Describe how you prepare yourself for the upcoming conflict, and thus which job you'll be using. **Your current [[Health]] score is also added to this roll as bonus dice**. If multiple reasons apply at once, then just choose the one you'd prefer to roll:

- **[[Deceiver]] + [[Health]]:** _You are defending yourself or another from inquiry, your trying to deny something, you're being deceptive, or this is a private argument._
- **[[Investigator]] + [[Health]]:** _You are pushing for information, you're trying to prove something, you're being honest, or this is a private argument._

This roll works a lot more like a [[Checks|Check]], in that **you're just looking to count successes here**. There's no inherent difficulty or factors either.

### Base Disposition

**The successes from the job roll above are added to a base Disposition score** ‚Äî which depends on your character's [[Tier]], using the table below ‚Äî **in addition to your [[#Presence|Presence]]**, to give you a total Disposition.

| Character Tier | **Base Disposition** |
| -------------: | :------------------: |
|       Ordinary |          10          |
|         Heroic |          15          |
|      Legendary |          20          |
|         Mythic |          25          |

‚ùì [[Non-player Characters*|NPCs]] usually use preset Presence and Disposition scores.

![[Momentum]]

## Tones

**At the start of each round, each standing speaker must choose and announce which tone they want to employ.** Your tone represents the mental 'posture' that you assume over the next few moments, which verbally signals to your opponents what you might be planning to say next.

The announcement of your tone can just be verbal, if you like, or you can use slips of paper and write your tone on it, **or play scissors-paper-stone** (ie. ‚úÇÔ∏è, üìÉ, ü™®), and then all reveal your tones at the same time.

Your tone determines _how much [[Momentum]] you add to the conflict at this start of the round_, and which [[#Moves|moves]] you can choose from on your turn:

| ‚úÇÔ∏è **Empathetic Tone** ‚úÇÔ∏è                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _This is emotional appeal. You are trying to invoke sympathy, pity, anger, fear, or some other emotion, using suggestive language and gravitas, or by telling stories._ |
| _**Momentum**_  +2                                                                                                                                                      |
| _**Moves:**_ [[Chide]], [[Endorse]], [[Plea]], [[Judge]] (Persuade), or [[Interact]]                                                                                 |

| üìÉ **Logical Tone** üìÉ                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _This is rational appeal. You are trying to argue from a position of objectivity, using facts and statistics, historical and literary analogies, or a framework of assumptions._ |
| _**Momentum**_ +1                                                                                                                                                                |
| _**Moves:**_ [[Endorse]], [[Question]], [[Obscure]], [[Judge]] (Prove), or [[Interact]]                                                                                       |

| ü™® **Ethical Tone** ü™®                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _This is moral appeal. You are trying to convince your opponent of the credibility of your character, by introducing your expertise, making yourself sound unbiased, and obeying proper syntax and procedure._ |
| _**Momentum**_ +0                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _**Moves:**_  [[Argue]], [[Chide]], [[Question]], [[Judge]] (Reject), or [[Interact]]                                                                                                                       |

‚ùó Once you've made your decision, the only way to change your tone in the middle of a round is via the 'Change Tone' [[#Exploits|exploit]].

> ### Nb.
>
> The tone you choose each round should also depend on how you speak in character, but don't worry too much if what you say doesn't match up exactly with what your character says, your intentions are more important here.
>
> Also note that if you do throw _scissors-paper-stone_ then **this is just an easy way to quickly choose and reveal your tone**, it doesn't mean that one inherently 'beats' the other. Though the corresponding symbols work as a mnemonic device too.

### Speechless

Some points can leave you astonished and lost for words, which is a very vulnerable position to be in. While speechless:

- **Your [[#Presence]] is reduced to 0**, and
- _Your next move suffers a +1 difficulty penalty_.

You may _clear your head_ on your turn using the [[Interact]] move, to remove the effect immediately, or you can suffer through the penalties and use the move you were intending to use while floundering, then _automatically remove the effect and clear your head at the end of the round_. Otherwise you must _use the 'Shake Off' [[#Exploits|exploit]]_, to clear your head early.

### Hesitation

Some attacks can cause 'hesitation'. This simply means that **your next move roll suffers a +1 difficulty penalty**, and it's cleared immediately afterwards. _The only way to remove hesitation before a roll is to use the 'Shake Off' [[#Exploits|exploit]]_.

‚ùó If multiple sources are causing hesitation _while you're already hesitating_ then **they do not stack**.

## Turn Order

**Start with the character who currently has the _highest_ Disposition, and progress the turn order down to the _lowest_**. A turn consists of: Rolling momentum, [[#Social Moves List|choosing a move]], and then performing that move.

‚ùì You can only act outside of your turn if you're given the opportunity to use an [[#Exploits|exploit]] by another character.

### Rounds

**Once each speaker has had a chance to act, a 'round' is said to have passed**.

At the end of each round, if a character's Disposition has raised or lowered for any reason, then they will move up or down the turn order, respectively. To make sure that no one accidentally goes twice or has their turn skipped, **only apply Disposition changes at the end of each round**.

‚ùó Each player need only track how much their own Disposition will change and _then tell the FC at the end of that round_, so their position on the momentum grid can be updated.

### Tied Disposition

If two or more characters have equal dispositions, then **they have to effectively take their actions simultaneously** on the same turn. This isn't physically possible in _out-of-game game time_, since each turn must be separately adjudicated, but _in game_ any "immediate" effects of each character's moves' are all applied instead at the end of the _collective turn_.

### No Disposition

If you're reduced to zero Disposition at the end of a round then you will lose your standing in the debate, and must either sit down and be quiet, or leave out of embarrassment or frustration. Uncomposed characters count as being [[#Speechless|speechless]], except _they can't use any moves_, and they may be automatically dismissed.

‚ùì Using the [[Judge]] move on a character with zero Disposition will automatically succeed without need for a roll, unless you are trying to reject them (in which case make an [[Honor]] check).

## Social Actions

There are three types of action a character can perform in a debate each round: **[[#Moves]]**, **[[#Free Actions]]**,  and **[[#Exploits]]**.

It is best to roleplay first ‚Äî according to your tone ‚Äî then choose the move and job that match what you said. You can also do it in reverse if you prefer though: Choosing the job and move first, and the describing what your character says to get there.

### Moves

Moves are the _main actions_ available to you each [[#Turn Order|turn]], determined by your current [[#tone Choice|tone]], and almost all moves require a job roll to be executed successfully (similar to a [[Tasks|Task]] roll but with most of the details already worked out for you).

**There are eight moves in total, which can be grouped into two categories, or four rough pairs:**

|      Offense |     | Utility      |
| -----------: | :-: | :----------- |
|    [[Argue]] |  ‚Äî  | [[Plea]]     |
|    [[Chide]] |  ‚Äî  | [[Endorse]]  |
| [[Question]] |  ‚Äî  | [[Obscure]]  |
| [[Judge]] |  ‚Äî  | [[Interact]] |

**Offensive** moves tend to either damage your opponent's Disposition, raise Momentum, or inflict _temporary_ [[Stress]], and benefit from the +MD. Whereas **Utility** moves tend to either repair that damage or cause different kinds of effects.

- **A move can only be performed if you're in the right [[#tone Choice|tone]] to use it**.
- Most moves require a particular [[Jobs|job]] or a choice of jobs to be used properly. (nb. When you see the x-o symbol ¬§ it means 'exclusive or' ‚Äî _choose one_).
- The bonuses and difficulties of the roll are all worked out as you read down the move, and should be fairly self-explanatory.
	- Though some moves also require the right facts to be true, or for you to [[#Rhetorical Fallacies|speak in a certain way]], to get the most benefit from them.
- You _may_ [[KISSing|KISS]] move rolls, but remember to _keep it short and sweet_.
	- _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_ from KISSing may be applied immediately, but no exp is earned from a failed move roll.
- **You may not use the same move two rounds in a row**.

‚ùì See the [[#Social Moves List]] below to read each move separately, or print off the [[move cards]] from the resources chapter.

### Free Actions

Every speaker can only attempt to use one move per round, but they may also take any of the following _free actions_ on their turn:

- **Look** ‚Äî Briefly take in your surroundings: Ask a simple question to your [[Facilitator|FC]] about the debate, such as the location and proximity of anything important in the scenery, or the names of people in the crowd.
- **Drop** ‚Äî Let go of something you're holding, like a weapon or another object, or a spell you've been concentrating on.
- **Relocate** ‚Äî Physically move around the scene, wander across the stage or into another room, or carry the scene around you as you walk and talk, and describe where you go.

Anything else that can be reasonably resolved with a simple [[Checks|Check]] in the middle of a debate may be deemed a free action by your [[Facilitator|FC]], so long as it doen't give any advantage over your opponents.

### Exploits

When an opponent uses a move against you that says _‚Äúyour opponent may exploit you‚Äù_ as a failure consequence ‚Äî which most offensive moves say, for example ‚Äî this means that **you may choose one following responses** (as an immediate free action):

- **Deny / Evade:** You bluntly reject or contradict your opponent, change the topic, or cut down their claims with a simple observation, which staggers their train of thought, and counts as [[#Hesitation|hesitation]] on their next roll (ie. _+1 difficulty factor, which can stack with other penalties_).
- **Change Tone:** If you haven't had your turn yet, you may _change to a different tone_ from the one you chose at the start of the round. _This does not change the Momentum you already generated_.
- **Shake Off:** If you are currently [[#Hesitation|hesitating]], [[#Speechless|struck speechless]], or otherwise hindered, you may shake it off and _remove all penalties or negative status effects_ that are afflicting you (or you may remove a point of _temporary_ stress from the argument).
- **Raise the Stakes:** You retort, and increase the Momentum of the debate for everyone by your opponent's [margin of failure] on their roll against you.

When you exploit an opponent, be sure to **describe what you do or say in response**, in proportion to their failure. This helps to keep everyone immersed in the action, so that the interaction isn't _purely mechanical_.

## Social Moves List

When you come to choose your move each turn, it's okay if you'd prefer to describe your action first and then use that description to guide you towards a certain move and job choice, or you can make the mechanical decision first and let that guide how you act. This is purely personal preference.

![[Argue]]

![[Plea]]

![[Chide]]

![[Endorse]]

![[Question]]

![[Obscure]]

![[Judge]]

![[Interact]]

![[Rhetorical Fallacies]]

## Settling a Debate

**Premises can be broadly grouped into three intents:** [[Persuade|Persuasions]], [[Reject|Rejections]], and [[Prove|Proofs]]. The intention of the premise has a mechanical effect when you come to pass [[Judge]], as it affects which jobs you can use to make your conclusion with, but it only matters narratively in the aftermath when you [[#Settling a Debate|settle the debate]].

#### Changing Premises

You may find through the debate that you change your mind about your premise. If this happens then pause the game and briefly discuss it. If you've become convinced of your opponent's premise before they judge you, for example, then there's not point in dragging the conflict out.

‚ùì Conversely, if your premise remains the same but your intentions have shifted, then the [[#Tones|tone]] you choose will determine what kind of judgment you can make.
