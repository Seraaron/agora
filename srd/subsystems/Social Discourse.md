## Social Discourse

When a discussion is turning into an argument, and **your difference of opinions can't be settled by agreeing to disagree**; when you know deep down that the other's theory is wrong, and that you need to prove that your theory is right; or when you're standing in court, on trial, or defending another; or simply having a friendly debate; _this is when discourse begins._

Social discourses are most often utilized in games that feature political intrigue, melodrama, and court sessions, or frequent debates about morality and ethics. They can also be used in adventure games to settle group disputes or to decide where to go next. A discourse _isn't_ a shouting match, and if it devolves into that then your differences may be better settled with a [[Martial Combat|fight]], or just a simple [[Opposed Tasks|Opposed task]] instead.

Before you get into dropping facts or spitting barbs, there's a little bit of bookeeping and set up to do first, to ensure that the debate runs smoothly for all the players:

-   **Each speaker must first determine three things: [[#Premises|Premises]], [[#Presence|Presence]], and [[#Composure|Composure]], in that order**.
-   **The other important number to keep an eye on during the debate is [[#Momentum]]**, which governs how intense the argument is getting and how close anyone is to being easily dismissed.

> #nb
> This system functions very similarly to [[Martial Combat|martial combat]], except using #social jobs instead of #martial ones. It can emulate anything from a private argument, to a public debate in front of a live crowd, or it can be used to sway a neutral third party one way or another.

###### Multiple Speakers

It is not really possible to run a discourse with more than two main speakers, it will quickly get unwieldy if there are three or more sets of arguments to track. Hence it is better to either take sides and [[Interact|aid]] one another with every roll, or to break the topic into smaller sequential debates.

If you do have a few people on your side, then you can either take it in turns to speak (and therefore roll) while receiving [[Helping|help]] from your allies, or you can have one person do all the talking while the rest just grant the odd bonus dice and a slight increase to [[#Presence|Presence]].

Everyone who enters the debate is tied to the consequences though!

---

### Premises

Your premise (or premisses) are a distillation of the core arguments you'll be making over the course of the debate into a single sentence. **It's _the side that you take_, so to speak, and _what you stand to gain_ if you win**. It's your position in the matter at hand, and the reason for whole argument in the first place.

Go around the table and let every character lay out their premise. This is a statement of intentions, and a setting of terms and conditions, and should be treated in a similar way as an [[Agenda|agenda]] — except it's an agenda for the whole conflict, not just one roll. Once you're happy with it, _you should write your premise down to help you roleplay through the scene_.

**Premises can be broadly grouped into three intents:** Proofs, Rejections, and Persuasions. The intention of the premise has a mechanical effect when you come to [[Dismiss]], as it affects which jobs you can use to make your conclusion with, but it only matters narratively in the aftermath when you [[#Settling a Debate|settle the debate]].

-   **Proofs** — You wish to make the truth known and clear to all. They have different, but incorrect, opinions. You're tying to be honest and you'll make them believe you.
    -   _**Uses:**_ Investigator, Pundit, or Steward
    -   If you win the argument then _your opponent cannot ignore or contradict your premise anymore_, though they may not like it.
-   **Rejections** — You wish to deny or refuse the request of another. They want something and you don't want them to have it. You're trying to ensure that something does not happen.
    -   _**Uses:**_ Cipher, Commander, or Diplomat
    -   If you win the argument then _your opponent is forbidden from raising their premise with you again_, or they are rendered powerless to try.
-   **Persuasions** — You wish to sway someone to your side or touch the hearts of your listeners. They are skeptical, but open to reason. You're trying to get something for the sake yourself or another.
    -   _**Uses:**_ Beggar, Charmer, or Orator
    -   If you win the argument then _you will have genuinely changed  the opponent's mind about your premise_, such that they join your cause.

#### Bound by Words

Agreeing to the premises binds you to the consequences of the conflict to the same degree that any other [[Agenda#Actions and Objectives|action and objective]] would. So, if everyone agrees to the premises then the argument can continue. If someone doesn't agree, then they must either try to renegotiate the terms or refuse to participate and leave the scene.

#que If two characters have the same (or similar) premises then they're considered to be on the same side, and if all characters already agree then there's no conflict.

#### Changing Premises

You may find through the debate that you change your mind about your premise. If this happens then pause the game and briefly discuss it. If you've become convinced of your opponent's premise before they even dismiss you, for example, then there's not point in dragging the conflict out.

#que Conversely, if your premise remains the same but your intentions have shifted, then just notify your [[Peers]] when you come to Dismiss.

### Presence

Presence represents _your projected self-confidence or reliance on status to protect you, combined with your age, supporters, and general mental and social athleticism._ First let the [[Facilitator|FC]] describe where the debate is taking place, who the important speakers are, and what the general atmosphere is like.

**Then calculate your Presence as follows:**

###### `   roundup((highest(Charmer, Assets) + 0-3)/ 2) + (Ability ≥ 3) `

-   Start with the highest of:
    -   Your **[[Charmer]] level**
    -   The sum of any **relevant [[Assets and Gear|Asset]] dice **
        -   (eg. your influence, position or power, social stature, etc.)
-   Add +1 for each [[Abilities#Mental Abilities|mental ability]] that is _rank 3 or better._
-   And add some conditional benefits:
    -   Add +1 _if you're the oldest speaker in the discourse?_
    -   Add +1 _if a present third party is known to already share your premise?_
    -   Add +1 _if you are historic enemies, or have had a similar debate like this before?_
-   Divide the total by 2 and round up!

**Presence is the base difficulty of using most offensive moves against you**, and so you will need to quote this number to other players frequently. Write it down on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], or somewhere easy to see. Presence is also _rolled_ as part of your initial [[#Composure|Composure calculation]], but it otherwise remains static.

#### Alternative Presence Jobs?

If the debate is of a scientific or theological nature then you must use your [[Philosopher]] level to calculate Presence, instead of [[Charmer]]. If it's about finance or estate management then use [[Steward]]. If it's about warfare and tactics then use [[Commander]].

### Composure

Composure represents the _your patience and calmness of mind or your general ability to spot nonsense and drivel,  combined with your strength of character relative to the other speakers_.  Composure does three main things during the discourse:

-   **It decides _the turn order_ for all speakers, from highest to lowest, which you can track using a grid of numbers and a token that represents your character. **
-   **It is the amount of [[Momentum]] that is needed for an opponent to try to _dismiss you with no major penalties_**.
-   **If you hit zero Composure during the debate then you must either sit down or excuse yourself from the scene, and you may be automatically _dismissed_ by another character.**

#### Roll Composure!

Describe how you prepare yourself for the upcoming conflict, and thus which job you'll be using. If multiple reasons apply at once, then just choose the one you'd prefer to roll:

-   **[[Cipher]] + [[#Presence|Presence]]:** _You are defending yourself, or another, from inquiry, your trying to reject something, you're being deceptive, or this is a private argument._
-   **[[Investigator]] + [[#Presence|Presence]]:** _You are pushing for information, you're trying to prove something, you're being honest, or this is a private argument._

This roll works a lot more like a [[Checks|Check]] roll, in that **you're just looking to count successes here**, but you cannot [[KISSing|KISS]] these dice, and there's no inherent difficulty or consequences.

#que **The roll should always be made with your [[Honor]] rank**, unless you aren't using that [[Capabilities|capability]] in your campaign.

#### Base Composure

**The successes from the job roll above are added to a base Composure score** — which depends on your character tier, using the table below — to give you a total Composure. _The highest possible total Composure is 60_.

|               Tier: | Ordinary | Heroic | Legendary | Mythic |
| ------------------: | :------: | :----: | :-------: | :----: |
| **Base Composure:** |    15    |   20   |     25    |   30   |

#que [[Non-player Characters|NPCs]] usually use a pre-set Presence and Composure score, but it may be rolled if the [[Facilitator|FC]] wishes.

![[Momentum]]

### Tones

**At the start of each round, each standing speaking must choose and announce which 'tone' they want to use.**

The announcement of your tone can just be verbal, if you like, or you can use slips of paper and write your tone on it and then all reveal your writings at the same time.

Your tone determines _which ability you should roll with to add to the [[Momentum]] this round_, and which [[#Moves|moves]] you can choose from this turn:

| **Ethical Tone**                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _This is moral appeal. You are trying to convince your opponent of the credibility of your character, by introducing your expertise, making yourself sound unbiased, and obeying proper syntax and procedure._ |
| _**Momentum:**_ +[[Wits]] check successes                                                                                                                                                                      |
| _**Moves:**_  [[Argue]] ∥ [[Detract]] ∥  [[Dismiss]] ∥ [[Interact]]                                                                                                                                            |

| **Empathetic Tone**                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _This is emotional appeal. You are trying to invoke sympathy, pity, anger, fear, or some other emotion, using suggestive language and gravitas, or by telling stories._ |
| _**Momentum:**_ +[[Appeal]] check successes                                                                                                                             |
| _**Moves:**_ [[Detract]] ∥ [[Endorse]] ∥ [[Interact]] ∥ [[Plea]]                                                                                                        |

| **Logical Tone**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _This is rational appeal. You are trying to argue from a position of objectivity, using facts and statistics, historical and literary analogies, or a framework of assumptions._ |
| _**Momentum:**_ +[[Resolve]] check successes                                                                                                                                     |

**In order to win an argument, proper use of ethos, pathos, and logos are required.**

> #nb
> The tone you choose each round should also depend on how you speak in character, but don't worry too much if what you say doesn't match up exactly with what your character says, your intentions are more important here.
>
> In fact, you don't even need to speak in character at all if you don't feel comfortable with it. You can just describe the broad strokes of what your character wants to talk about, and roughly how they make their case, or how they act a certain way.

#### Speechless

Some attacks can leave you lost for words, which is a very vulnerable position to be in. We can present being speechless like a stance, but it doesn't add any Momentum and your only real option is to spend your turn unwinding your thoughts and finding your words again:

| **Struck Speechless**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _You are confounded or tongue-tied. You either can't say anything at all, or the words just aren't coming out right. You need to take a deep breath and try to brush off the embarrassment._ |
| _**Momentum:**_ +0                                                                                                                                                                           |
| _**Moves:**_ [[#Interact]]                                                                                                                                                                   |

#que In other words, being struck speechless means **you effectively lose your next turn**, unless you receive a lucky [[#Exploits|exploit]] before it starts.

#### Changing Tone

Everyone has to declare their tone at the start of the round, but you may occasionally find that circumstances have changed by the time it gets to your turn. Therefore:

-   **You _may_ change your tone to a different one on your turn, but the move you then use will suffer a +1 difficulty factor to any rolls as a result**.
-   **Alternatively:** You may get the opportunity to use the 'Change Tone' [[#Exploits|exploit]] before your turn starts, in which case no such penalty is applied.

### Turn Order

**Start with the character who currently has the _highest_ Composure, and progress the turn order down to the _lowest_**. A turn consists of: Rolling momentum, [[#Discourse Moves List|choosing a move]], and then performing that move.

#que You can only act outside of your turn if you're given the opportunity to use an [[#Exploits|exploit]] by another character.

**Once each speaker has had a chance to act, a 'round' is said to have passed**.

-   If two or more characters _on the same side_ all have their turns one-after-another, then **they may reorder themselves at the start of the round**, swapping they're Composure scores as they please.
-   If two or more characters _on opposing sides_ have the same Composure then the one with the **highest Presence goes first**. (If these are also the same then the one who rolls the highest Momentum goes first).

At the end of each round, if a character's Composure has raised or lowered for any reason, then they will move up or down the turn order, respectively. To make sure that no one accidentally goes twice or has their turn skipped, **only apply Composure changes at the end of each round**.

#imp Each player need only track how much their own Composure will change and _then tell the FC at the end of that round_, so their position on the momentum grid can be updated.

#### No Composure

If you're reduced to zero Composure at the end of a round then you will lose your standing in the debate, and must either sit down and be quiet, or leave out of embarrassment or frustration. Uncomposed characters count as being [[#Speechless|speechless]], except _they can't use any moves_, and they may be automatically dismissed.

#que Using the [[Dismiss]] move on a character with zero Composure will automatically succeed without need for a roll, unless you are trying to reject them (in which case make an [[Honor]] check).

### Social Actions

There are two types of action a character can perform in a debate each round: **[[#Moves]]** and **[[#Exploits]]**.

It is best to roleplay first — according to your tone — then choose the move and job that match what you said. You can also do it in reverse if you prefer though: Choosing the job and move first, and the describing what your character says to get there.

#### Moves

Moves are the _main actions_ available to you each [[#Turn Order|turn]], determined by your current [[#tone Choice|tone]], and almost all moves require a job roll to be executed successfully (similar to a [[Tasks|Task]] roll but with all the details already worked out for you).

**There are eight moves in total, which can be grouped into two categories, or four pairs:**

|      Offense |  —  | Utility      |
| -----------: | :-: | :----------- |
|    [[Argue]] |  —  | [[Plea]]     |
|  [[Detract]] |  —  | [[Endorse]]  |
| [[Question]] |  —  | [[Obscure]]  |
|  [[Dismiss]] |  —  | [[Interact]] |

**Offensive** moves tend to either damage your opponent's Composure or _temporarily_ inflict [[Stress]], and benefit from the +MD, whereas **Utility** moves tend to either repair that damage or strike someone speechless.

-   Each move can only be performed if you've assumed the right [[#tone Choice|tone]] to use it.
-   Most moves require a particular [[Jobs|job]] or a choice of jobs to be used properly.
    -   When you see the double-bar symbol ∥ it means 'or'. _Choose one._
-   The bonuses and difficulties of the roll are all worked out as you read down the move, and should be fairly self-explanatory.
    -   Though some moves also require the right facts to be true, or for you to speak in a certain way, to get the most benefit from them.
-   _You **may** these [[KISSing|KISS]] move rolls, but remember to keep it short and sweet._

#que See the [[#Discourse Moves List]] below to read each move separately, or print off the [[move cards]] from the resources chapter.

#### Exploits

When a move says _“your opponent may exploit you”_ as a failure consequence — which most offensive moves say, for example — this means that your target may choose to take one following responses (as an immediate free action, also called a 'reaction'):

-   **Change Tone:** If they haven't had their turn yet, the target may _change to a different tone_ from the one they chose at the start of the round, without incurring any penalties to their next move.
-   **Deny:** The target bluntly rejects or contradicts you, or cuts down your claim with a simple observation, which staggers your train of thought, counting as a hindrance (_+1 difficulty factor_) to your next move roll (_which can stack with other penalties_).
-   **Shake Off:** If the target is staggered, hesitating, or otherwise hindered, they may shake it off and _remove a penalty or negative status effect_ that's afflicting them. (Or if they are speechless, they may immediately re-find their words).
-   **Raise the Stakes:** The target may may raise the Momentum of the battle for everyone by the margin of failure on your roll against them. They should describe what they do or say in response to you, in proportion to your failure, which raises the tension for everyone.

### Discourse Moves List

#imp Instead of tracking your failures during combat, which would slow down the game's pace, _[[#Settling a Debate|at the end of a conflict]]_ **you earn _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_ equal any [[Lots]] spent plus the MD bonus that the debate finished on**, and you must distribute those points _relatively evenly_ among all the jobs you rolled with during the battle.

###### Rhetorical Fallacies

You will have probably noticed in the moves — but also in the system in general — a number of references to various rhetorical devices. These devices are tools,  used to help make rhetorical arguments. If you're not familiar, then this is all part of the so-called _'art of persuasion'_.

**The social discourse system _doesn't_ model the platonic ideal of rhetorical debate**. Indeed, there are times when using such fallacies is actually rewarded. A fallacy is a type of deception that  discourages an open exchange of ideas. They instead try to distract or mislead using flawed reasoning.

Here we shall list the most common types of rhetorical fallacy, and divide them among the [[#Tones|three tones]]. This isn't an exhaustive list, but it's here so that you can learn roughly how they work to start developing your skills. Then you can decide how to use, spot, or avoid them, as you desire.

---

###### _Ethical Fallacies_

-   **Appeal to Authority over Reason** — You offer someone's personal authority as proof, or ask they are trusted simply because of their position of power.
-   **Character Assassination** _or 'ad hominem'_ — You attack someone's character rather than their reasoning.
-   **False Expert** _or 'fake evidence'_ — You ask your opponent to agree with you based on the assertion of another who isn't actually qualified to make such an assertion (or you pretend to be an expert or make up evidence yourself).
-   **Guilt by Association** _or 'genetic fallacy'_ — You call someone into question simply because of their relations, friends, or heritage.
-   **Dogmatism** — You shut down a discussion by asserting that your beliefs are the only acceptable ones.
-   **Misrepresenting the Opponent** _or 'propping up strawmen'_ — You set up theoretical counter arguments with the intent of easily dismantling them or to misrepresent another position.
-   **Moral Equivalence** — You unjustly compare minor problems with much more serious ones (or _vise versa_).

---

###### _Empathetic Fallacies_

-   **Appeal to Emotion** —You rely on sentimentality to distract from the facts.
-   **Appeal to Popularity** _or 'bandwagoning'_ — You encourage agreement with the popular opinion simply because it's popular.
-   **Exclusionary Choice** _or 'presenting an ultimatum'_ — You reduce a complex issue down to only two possible courses of action, and usually bias one side or the other in your favor.
-   **Manufactured Need** — You create an unnecessary desire for something.
-   **Red Herrings** _or 'burying the lead'_ — You make a misleading argument or bring up unrelated evidence to support your conclusion.
-   **Scare Tactics** — You try to frighten your opponent with threats or by predicting unrealistically dire consequences.
-   **Slippery Slope** — Your arguments suggest that one thing will lead to another, often with disastrous results.

---

###### _Logical Fallacies_

-   **Assuming the Conclusion** _or 'circular arguments'_ — You restate the claim in such a way that it appears self-evident, even though it isn't.
-   **Confused Causality** _or 'post hoc arguments'_ — You assume that correlation implies causation, or that one event necessarily precedes another, when it doesn't.
-   **Equivocation** _or 'lie by omission'_ — You make a half-true statement but obfuscate certain details, or use deliberately vague language.
-   **Faulty Analogy** — You make an inaccurate or inappropriate comparison between two things, or tell a misleading story with a pedagogic intent.
-   **Hasty Generalizations** _or 'hearsay and conjecture'_ — You draw a conclusion from scarcely any evidence, or from the unsubstantiated claims of others.
-   **Leaps in Logic** _or 'non sequitur'_ — You make a statement that does not follow from any previous statement, but you act like it does.
-   **Stacked Argument** — You disallow any counter argument or opposing evidence to be raised against you, thus distorting the issue.
