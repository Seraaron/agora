#### Ammo Types

Unlike most other weapons, bows and crossbows don't came with an inherent damage tag. Instead they have the #ammo-type tag which means you can choose your damage for [[Spur|spur]] attacks based on the shape of nose of the ammo you nock:

#slashing  — _Leaf nose._ A good all-rounder against most opponents and armor weights. This is the default arrow head unless you specify otherwise.

#piercing  — _Diamond nose._ Has a case-hardened or 'steeled' point to help it to penetrate through thin plate segments, maille, and weak spots.

#rending  — _Broad nose._ These have razor sharp edges and barbed ends. Typically used for hunting, as they are superior against unarmored foes and tough hides.

#binding — _Blunt nose_. Typically used for target practice or birding. Some have a crescent nose which catches on reeds and twigs more easily, making them easier to retrieve.

#question There is no practical #bashing nose, they're just too heavy to fly.

##### Quantities

You don't have to worry about counting and tracking individual bolts and arrows — _though you must declare before shooting what ammo type you'll be using_ — instead we can assume that you have enough arrows to last a few battles before you must restock: **_Roll a d6 after every other fight_, and if you roll a 1 then you only have one arrow remaining**.
