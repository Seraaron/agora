#slashing  — _Leaf nose._ A good all-rounder against most opponents and armor weights. This is the default arrow head unless you specify otherwise.

#piercing  — _Diamond nose._ Has a case-hardened or 'steeled' point to help it to penetrate through thin plate segments, maille, and weak spots.

#rending  — _Broad nose._ These have razor sharp edges and barbed ends. Typically used for hunting, as they are superior against unarmored foes and tough hides.

#binding — _Blunt nose_. Typically used for target practice or birding. Some have a crescent nose which catches on reeds and twigs more easily, making them easier to retrieve.

#que There is no practical #bashing nose, they're just too heavy to fly.
