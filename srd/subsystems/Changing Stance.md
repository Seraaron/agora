#### Changing Stance

Everyone has to declare their stance at the start of the round, but you may occasionally find that circumstances have changed by the time it gets to your turn. Therefore:

-   **You _may_ change your stance to a different one on your turn, but the move you then use will suffer a +1 difficulty factor to any rolls as a result**.
    -   Although, if the move has no roll then you're okay.
-   **Alternatively:** You may get the opportunity to use the 'Change Stance' exploit before your turn starts, in which case no such penalty is applied.
