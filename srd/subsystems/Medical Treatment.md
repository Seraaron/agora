#### Time to Recover

The following table can help you to approximate how long it should take for certain wounds to heal, how difficult it should be for a [[Physician]] to treat such wounds — with no other complicating factors — _so that [[Wounds and Scars#Convalescence|convalescence]] can begin_, and what kinds of weapons cause that kind of damage in the first place:

| Wound Type                         |              Damage Tag              | Treatment Difficulty |      Convalescence     |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------: | :------------------: | :--------------------: |
| **Scrapes, Bumps, or Bruises**     |               #binding               |           1          |          Weeks         |
| **Burns, Freezes, or Shocks**      | #burning #freezing #lightning #magic |           1          |          Weeks         |
| **Deep Cuts or Incisions**         |          #slashing #piercing         |           2          |         Months         |
| **Crushed Muscles**                |               #crushing              |           2          |         Months         |
| **Organ Damage or Rupture**        |          #piercing #rending          |           3          |         Seasons        |
| **Broken Bones or Cracked Skulls** |          #bashing #crushing          |           3          |         Seasons        |
| **Amputations or Transplants**     |               #rending               |           4          |          Years         |
| **Multiples of Wounds**            |                 #any                 |           4          |          Years         |
| **Psychological Damage**           |                 #any                 |           5          | _Depends on Treatment_ |
| **Disease, Poison, or Radiation**  |             #magic #poison-x            |           X          | _Depends on Poison_ |

If multiple [[Player Characters|PCs]] are wounded, this can be a good indicator that it's time to _skip ahead in-game by a few months while you all recover_, giving you plenty of [[Downtime and Travel|downtime scenes]], unless time is of the essence.
