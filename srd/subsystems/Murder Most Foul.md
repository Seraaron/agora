#### A Murder Most Foul!

Killing in cold blood requires that you make an [[Archer]], [[Gunner]], [[Skirmisher]], or [[Warrior]] roll (with [[Grit]]). _Murder_ implies that the target is **not also trying to kill you**, so this could be done with an [[Opposed Tasks#Asymmetrical Opposition|Asymetrically Opposed task]] (using their [[Martial Combat#Poise|poise]] as the base difficulty). However, the rules of Asymmetrical tasks state that the defending character can effectively _“set the conditions under which they would accept defeat”_, and anyone with a sense of self-preservation would likely never accept defeat when their life is on the line.

Instead, it _may be fairer_ to use a [[Opposed Tasks#Symmetrical Opposition|Symmetrical Opposition]] and have the targeted character roll their [[Acrobat]], [[Guard]], [[Martialist]], or [[Trickster]] job, and make the consequences lop-sided: **If you win then you kill them, if they win then they escape with their life**.

You may add your weapon dice to this roll, and your target may add any armor or shield dice to theirs. Attempting to murder someone is _always [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]]_.

If a character is fighting back fully, then you both have the intent to kill and thus must both use one of the aforementioned jobs (with [[Grit]]), or else progress to a full [[Martial Combat|combat]].

#question If you're not using [[Grit]] in your campaign then use [[Resolve]] instead.
