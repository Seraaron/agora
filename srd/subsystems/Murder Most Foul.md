#### A Murder Most Foul!

Killing in cold blood requires that you make an [[Archer]], [[Gunner]], [[Skirmisher]], or [[Warrior]] roll. _Murder_ implies that the target is **not also trying to kill you**.

This should be done with [[Opposed Tasks]], but instead of each of you rolling the same job and splitting into two pools, your target should roll a job like [[Acrobat]], [[Brawler]], [[Guard]], [[Hunter]], or [[Thief]].

**All of your levels and weapon dice go into the offensive pool, and all of their level and armor dice go into their defensive pool, and then you both roll.** This is always a [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]] roll.

If you win they will will be at your mercy, and if they win then they've successfully hidden, beaten you back, or escaped.

Once your victim is at your mercy, **you must make one final [[Grit]] check to actually kill them**. (If they are a player character then they will probably lose a point of [[Health]] and take a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]] instead). 

‚ùì If you're not using [[Grit]] in your campaign then use [[Resolve]] instead.
