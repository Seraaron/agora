### Rhetorical Fallacies

You will have probably noticed in the social move descriptions — but also in the [[Social Discourse]] system in general — a number of references to various rhetorical devices. These are tools you can use to help you raise points and make your arguments. If you're not familiar, then this is all part of the so-called _[art of persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric)_.

**The social discourse system _doesn't_ model the platonic ideal of rhetorical debate**. Indeed, there are times when using such fallacies is actually rewarded. A fallacy is a type of deception that  discourages an open exchange of ideas. They instead try to distract or mislead using flawed reasoning.

Here we shall list the most common types of rhetorical fallacy, and divide them among the [[Social Discourse#Tones|three tones]]. This isn't an exhaustive list, but it's here so that you can learn roughly how they work to start developing your skills. Then you can decide how to use, spot, or avoid them, as you desire.

#### _Ethical Fallacies:_

- **Appeal to Authority over Reason** — You offer someone's personal authority as proof, or ask they are trusted simply because of their position of power.
- **Character Assassination** _or 'ad hominem'_ — You attack someone's character rather than their reasoning.
- **False Expert** _or 'fake evidence'_ — You ask your opponent to agree with you based on the assertions of another person who isn't actually qualified to make such statements (or you pretend to be an expert or make up evidence yourself).
- **Guilt by Association** _or 'genetic fallacy'_ — You call someone into question simply because of their relations, friends, or heritage.
- **Dogmatism** — You shut down a discussion by asserting that your beliefs are the only acceptable ones.
- **Misrepresenting the Opponent** _or 'propping up strawmen'_ — You set up theoretical counter arguments with the intent of easily dismantling them or to misrepresent another position.
- **Moral Equivalence** — You unjustly compare minor problems with much more serious ones (or _vise versa_).

#### _Empathetic Fallacies:_

- **Appeal to Emotion** —You rely on sentimentality to distract from the facts.
- **Appeal to Popularity** _or 'bandwagoning'_ — You encourage agreement with the popular opinion simply because it's popular.
- **Exclusionary Choice** _or 'presenting an ultimatum'_ — You reduce a complex issue down to only two possible courses of action, and usually bias one side or the other in your favor.
- **Manufactured Need** — You create an unnecessary desire for something.
- **Red Herrings** _or 'burying the lead'_ — You make a misleading argument or bring up unrelated evidence to support your conclusion.
- **Scare Tactics** — You try to frighten your opponent with threats or by predicting unrealistically dire consequences.
- **Slippery Slope** — Your arguments suggest that one thing will lead to another, often with disastrous results.

#### _Logical Fallacies:_

- **Assuming the Conclusion** _or 'circular arguments'_ — You restate the claim in such a way that it appears self-evident, even though it isn't.
- **Confused Causality** _or 'post hoc arguments'_ — You assume that correlation implies causation, or that one event necessarily precedes another, when it doesn't.
- **Equivocation** _or 'lie by omission'_ — You make a half-true statement but obfuscate certain details, or use deliberately vague language.
- **Faulty Analogy** — You make an inaccurate or inappropriate comparison between two things, or tell a misleading story with a pedagogic intent.
- **Hasty Generalizations** _or 'hearsay and conjecture'_ — You draw a conclusion from scarcely any evidence, or from the unsubstantiated claims of others.
- **Leaps in Logic** _or 'non sequitur'_ — You make a statement that does not follow from any previous statement, but you act like it does.
- **Stacked Argument** — You disallow any counter argument or opposing evidence to be raised against you, thus distorting the issue.
