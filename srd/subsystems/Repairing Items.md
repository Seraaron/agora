#### Repairing Items

**The difficulty to repair an object is equal to _half_ of it's [[Crafting|creation difficulty]] (rounded up)**, with bonus dice granted to the craftsman from the item's [[Assets and Gear#Quality Rating|quality]]. Quality cannot be improved by a repair, but _it can be reduced if the repair takes multiple rolls_.

‚ùó If a repair takes more than three attempts then the item is destroyed.
