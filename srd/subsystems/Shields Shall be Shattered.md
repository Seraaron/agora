#### Shields Shall be Shattered

When you are using a shield and a [[Kill|kill]] move is successfully used against you, **your shield will shatter and negate the killing blow**, and you will take a point of stress instead:

- [[Pain]] if you're in aggressive stance.
- [[Shock]] if you're in counteractive stance.
- [[Fatigue]] if you're in defensive stance.

**Then you lose the protective benefit of your shield, unless you find another, but at least you're still alive!**

However, if the weapon being used against you has the #great tag, _and your shield doesn't_, then your shield still shatters but the blow *isn't* negated.

That is, **only a great shield can negate a killing blow from a great weapon**.

Similarly, only magic shields can be shattered against magic attacks, and only bullet-proof shield can be shattered against firearm shots.

#question Thus *if you're fighting a dual but don't want it to be deadly*, you can fight until the first shield is shattered (or the first to three) and then declare the victor.
