#### Alchemy

Choose a desired effect to reproduce from the following list — or _interpret and expand on_ the following to create new and unique effects, with your [[Peers|Peers' approval]] — this sets the base difficulty of the roll:

1. **Essential Distillation:** Ore ↦ Ingot, Seawater ↦ Salt, Latex ↦ Rubber, Sugar ↦ Alcohol, Metal ↦ Poison, Bitumen ↦ Fuel, etc.

2. **Elemental Entropy:** Stone ⇌ Sand, Wood ⇌ Soil, Ice ⇌ Water, Iron ⇌ Rust, Fire ⇌ Ash, Air ⇌ Vacuum, etc.

3. **Physical Transportation:** Swap the positions of two objects of roughly equal mass in identical ritual circles anywhere else in the world.

4. **Chemical Arithmetic:** Water ⇔ _Hydrogen_ + _Oxygen_, Salt ⇔ _Sodium_ + _Chlorine_, Ruby ⇔ _Aluminum_ + _Oxygen_ + _Chromium_, etc.

5. **Atomic Miracle:** Lead ↯ Gold, Water ↯ Wine, Wood ↯ Steel, Coal ↯ Diamond, etc.

Only _non-living material_ can be directly affected by alchemy.

##### Specific Factors:

Decide how much stuff you want to affect in the process, according to the total mass, and increase the difficulty by that much:

|   Mass Unit | Difficulty | _Approx. Modern Equivalent_ |
| ----------: | :--------: | :-------------------------- |
|  **Shekel** |     +0     | _~ 0.3 oz / 8.5 g_          |
|    **Mina** |     +1     | _~ 1 lb / 500 g_            |
|  **Talent** |     +2     | _~ 67 lbs / 30 kg_          |
| **Quintal** |     +3     | _~ 220 lbs / 100 kg_        |
|   **Tonne** |     +4     | _~ 2205 lbs / 1000 kg_      |
|    **Keel** |     +5     | _~ 424 cwt / 21.54 tn_      |

##### Time and Circles

The alchemy itself occurs _almost instantaneously_ once the [[Alchemist]] is ready to perform their work, but **drawing the appropriate ritual circles takes many hours:** _Equal to the difficulty of the tasks they were designed for_. The circles must also completely surround or enclose the target. However, you may draw ritual circles well in advance of needing to use them, and they may be re-used so long as nothing disrupts them.
