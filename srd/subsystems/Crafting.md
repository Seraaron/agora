#### Crafting

When you want to make your own [[Assets and Gear|gear]]  — such as armor, weapons, or tools — first consider the quality you want to produce and the materials you will need to make it.

- **Use the number of bonus dice you wish the item to grant when its used as the base difficulty:**
- For most tools and weapons, this is always 0.
- For body armor, it is between 2 and 6.
- For shields and helmets, it's between 1 and 3.
- **Each tag that you want the item have adds +1 to the base difficulty** (+1/#).
- _Hyphenated tags add an extra +1 difficulty per hyphen_ (+1/-).
- Then add specific or [[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]] (see below).

##### Specific Factors:

- “Crafting multiples at once...? (_+1 factor per copy_)
- “Using inappropriate materials, or having to make substitutions...?
- “The design style demands great embellishment, high attention to detail, or rare materials...? (_increases worth but not functionality_)

##### Appropriate Materials

Your [[Peers]] may veto a crafting project that seems incongruous with the technology and materials you're using, especially _without the aid of magic_.

> ### Eg.
> _You can't create +5 armor out of cloth or leather, or make a +2 sword from wrought bronze or pig iron, or build a plasma rifle in the middle ages._

Be reasonable, and stick to your setting's established [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|genre, tone, and themes]]. **Use the [[Gear List|gear list]] as a guide.**

Similarly, the predominant material you've selected may change the job you should use: [[Clothier]] uses mostly cloth and leather, [[Wright]] uses mostly wood and stone, and [[Smith]] uses mostly metal and machines.

##### Determining Quality

Although similar in function, the number of dice an item inherently grants and its _'quality'_ are two separate variables. Quality comes in three types — [[Common-Quality|common]], [[Excellent-Quality|excellent]], and [[Superior-Quality|superior]] — which grant +0-2 dice to all rolls or calculations made with them, including repair rolls, respectively.

You _cannot decide_ what quality the items you want to make will be, you can only try to make them as best you can. **This depends on how many rolls it takes you to complete the project.** Unlike a normal [[Tasks|Task]], we count smithing successes _cumulatively_ over several rolls, and this determines the final quality of the item:

1. One roll = [[Superior-Quality]] (+2 dice)
2. Two rolls = [[Excellent-Quality]] (+1 dice)
3. Three rolls = [[Common-Quality]] (+0 dice)

##### Crafting Time

**Each roll takes a minimum number of days equal to the total difficulty**, which may generate [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]] for the other players. If your making armor, or something larger, then use a multiple of weeks instead of days. Margin of success may also reduce this time.

##### Judging Failure

When it comes to earning _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_ from these rolls, consider the process as a whole and only count a failure if the item doesn't meet your personal standards or the comissioner's expectations. _Let your [[Peers]] keep you honest_.

#important If the project takes **more than three rolls** then _the item is ruined_, the materials are lost, and you'll have to start again. This definitely counts as a failure.
