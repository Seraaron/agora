### Crafting

When you want to make your own [[Assets and Gear#Gear|gear]]  — such as armor, weapons, or tools — first consider the quality you want to produce and the materials you will need to make it.

**Use the die rating of the item as the base difficulty:**

- For most tools and weapons, this is always 0.
- For body armor, it is between 2 and 6.
- For shields and helmets, it's between 1 and 3.

**Each tag that you want the item have adds +1 to the base difficulty** (+1/#). _Hyphenated tags add an extra +1 difficulty per hyphen_ (+1/-). Some tags may also be _imposed_ by your FC because of technological or material limitations (especially on [[Using Guns|firearms]]).

❓ Quality is determined [[#Determining Quality|as a part of the roll]] itself.

##### Specific Factors:

- “Crafting multiples at once...? (_+1 factor per copy_)
- “Using inappropriate materials, or having to make substitutions...?
- “The design style demands great embellishment, high attention to detail, or rare materials...? (_increases worth but not functionality_)

#### Appropriate Tools & Materials

Your [[Peers]] may veto a crafting project that seems incongruous with the technology and materials you're using, especially _without the aid of magic_.

> ### Eg.
>
> _You can't create +5 armor out of cloth or leather, or make a +2 sword from wrought bronze or pig iron, or build a plasma rifle in the middle ages._

Be reasonable, and stick to your setting's established [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|genre, tone, and themes]]. **Use the [[Gear List|gear list]] as a guide.** Though, you may add bonus dice to the roll if you're using excellent or superior quality tools.

❓ Similarly, the predominant material you've selected may change the job you should use: [[Clothier]] uses mostly cloth and leather, [[Wright]] uses mostly wood and stone, and [[Smith]] uses mostly metal and machines.

#### Determining Quality

Although similar in function, the number of dice an item inherently grants and its _'quality rating'_ are two separate variables. Quality comes in three types — [[Common-Quality|common]], [[Excellent-Quality|excellent]], and [[Superior-Quality|superior]] — which may grant bonus dice to all rolls or calculations made with them, including [[Repairing Items|repair rolls]].

_You cannot decide what quality the items you want to make will be_, you can only try to make them as best you can. **This depends on how many rolls it takes you to complete the project.** Unlike a normal [[Tasks|Task]], we count crafting successes _cumulatively_ over several rolls, and this determines the final quality of the item:

1. One roll = **[[Superior-Quality]]** (+2 dice)
2. Two rolls = **[[Excellent-Quality]]** (+1 dice)
3. Three rolls = **[[Common-Quality]]** (+0 dice)

##### Crafting Time

**Each roll takes a minimum number of days equal to the total difficulty**, which may generate [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]] for the other players. _If your making armor, or something larger, then use a multiple of weeks instead of days_. Margin of success may also reduce this time, proportionately.

##### Judging Failure

When it comes to earning _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_ from these rolls, consider the process as a whole and only **count a failure if the item doesn't meet your personal standards** or the comissioner's expectations. _Let your [[Peers]] keep you honest_.

❗ If the project takes **more than three rolls** then _the item is ruined_, the materials are lost, and you'll have to start again. This definitely counts as a failure.
