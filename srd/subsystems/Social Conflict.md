## Social Conflict

blah blah blah #unfinished introduction

Before you get into dropping facts or spitting any vitriol, there's a little bit of bookeeping and set up to do first, to ensure that the debate runs smoothly for all the players:

-   **Each speaker must first determine two things: [[#Calculate Presence|Presence]], and initial [[#Roll Composure|Composure]], in that order**.
-   **The other important number to keep an eye on during the debate is [[#Momentum]]**, which governs how intense the argument is getting and how close anyone is to being easily dismissed.

> #nb
> This system can be used to emulate anything from a private _but heated_ argument, to a public discourse in front of a live crowd.
>
> While it _is_ possible to run a debate with more than two main speakers, it will quickly get unwieldy if there are more than three or fours sets of arguments to track. Hence it is better to either take sides and aid one another with every roll, or to break the topic into smaller sequential debates.

### Calculate Presence

blah blah blah #unfinished presence explanation

**Then calculate your Presence as follows:**

###### `roundup((highest(Charmer, Assets) + 0-3)/ 2)`

-   Start with the highest of:
    -   Your **[[Charmer]]  level***
    -   The sum of **any relevant [[Assets and Gear|Asset]] dice **
        -   (eg. your influence, position or power, or social stature)
-   Add +1 _if you're more introverted and having this conversation in private, or if you're more extroverted and having it in public?_
-   Add +1 _if you're...?_
-   Add +1 _if ...?_
-   Divide the total by 2 and round up

#ast If the debate is of a scientific, theological, or financial nature, then you must instead use your [[Scholar]], [[Priest]], or [[Steward]] level, respectively.

### Roll Composure!

blah blah blah #unfinished composure explanation

#### Job Choice

Describe how you prepare yourself for the upcoming conflict, and thus which job you'll be using. If multiple reasons apply at once, then just choose the one you'd prefer to roll:

-   **[[Investigator]] ([[Honor|Hon]]) + [[#Calculate Presence|Presence]] (rolled as dice):** _You are pushing for information... or this is a private argument._
-   **[[Cipher]] ([[Honor|Hon]]) + [[#Calculate Presence|Presence]] (rolled as dice):** _You are defending yourself, or another, from inquiry... or this is a private argument._

This roll works much like any other [[Tasks|Task]] roll; except **you're just looking to count successes here**, there's no inherent difficulty or consequences, and you cannot [[KISSing|KISS]].

**The roll should always be made with your [[Honor]] rank**, unless you aren't using that [[Capabilities|capability]] in your campaign.

#### Base Composure

blah blah blah #unfinished based composure explanation

|               Tier: | Ordinary | Heroic | Legendary | Mythic |
| ------------------: | :------: | :----: | :-------: | :----: |
| **Base Composure:** |    15    |   20   |     25    |   30   |

![[Momentum]]

### Stances

**At the start of each round, each standing speaking must choose and announce which 'stance' they enter.**

The announcement of your stance can just be verbal, if you like, or you can use slips of paper and write your stance on it and then all reveal your writings at the same time.

Your stance determines _which ability you should roll with to add to the [[Momentum]] this round_, and which [[#Moves|moves]] you can choose from this turn:

| **Aggressive Stance**                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| _Aaaa._                                             |
| _**Momentum:**_ +[[Wits]] check successes           |
| _**Moves:**_  [[Assume]] ∥ [[Chide]] ∥  [[Dismiss]] |

| **Counteractive Stance**                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| _Bbbb_.                                             |
| _**Momentum:**_ +[[Appeal]] check successes         |
| _**Moves:**_ [[Chide]] ∥ [[Endorse]] ∥ [[Question]] |

| **Defensive Stance**                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Cccc._                                                           |
| _**Momentum:**_ +[[Resolve]] check successes                      |
| _**Moves:**_ [[Endorse]] ∥ [[Interact]] ∥ [[Obscure]] ∥ [[Treat]] |

> #nb
> The stance you choose each round should also depend on how you speak in character, but don't worry too much if what you say doesn't match up exactly with what your character says, your intentions are more important here.
>
> In fact, you don't even need to speak in character at all if you don't feel comfortable with it. You can just describe the broad strokes of what your character wants to talk about, and roughly how they make their case, or how they act a certain way.

![[Changing Stance]]

### Turn Order

**Start with the character who currently has the _highest_ Composure, and progress the turn order down to the _lowest_**. A turn consists of: Rolling momentum, choosing a move, performing that move. You can only act outside of your turn if you're given the opportunity to use an [[#Exploits|exploit]] by another character.

**Once every speaker has had a chance to act, a 'round' is said to have passed**.

-   If two or more characters _on the same team_ all have their turns one-after-another, then **they may reorder themselves at the start of the round**, swapping they're Composure scores as they please.
-   If two or more characters _on opposing teams_ have the same Composure then the one with the **highest Presence goes first**. (If these are also the same then the one who rolls the highest Momentum goes first, and if _that_ is also the same then just flip a coin).

At the end of each round, if a character's Composure has raised or lowered for any reason, then they will move up or down the turn order, respectively. To make sure that no one accidentally goes twice or has their turn skipped, make sure to **only apply Stamina changes at the end of each round**. To make that easier, each player should track how much their own Stamina will change and then tell the FC at the end of that round.

#### No Composure

If you're reduced to zero Composure at the end of a round then you will lose your standing in the debate, and must either sit down and be quiet, or leave out of embarrassment or frustration, _and you cannot use any more moves_.

#que Using the [[Dismiss]] move on a character with zero Composure will automatically succeed without need for a roll, unless you are trying to intimidate them (in which case roll [[Honor]]).

### Social Actions

There are two types of action a character can perform in a debate each round: **[[#Moves]]** and **[[#Exploits]]**.

Roleplay first — according to your stance — then choose the move that matches what you said. #rewrite 

#### Moves

Moves are the _main actions_ available to you each [[#Turn Order|turn]], determined by your current [[#Stance Choice|stance]], and almost all moves require a job roll to be executed successfully (similar to a [[Tasks|Task]] roll but with all the details already worked out for you).

**There are eight moves in total, which can be grouped into two categories:**

|   |      Offense |     | Utility      |
| - | -----------: | :-: | ------------ |
|   |   [[Assume]] |  —  | [[Treat]]    |
|   |    [[Chide]] |  —  | [[Endorse]]  |
|   | [[Question]] |  —  | [[Obscure]]  |
|   |  [[Dismiss]] |  —  | [[Interact]] |

-   Each move can only be performed if you're in the right [[#Stance Choice|stance]] to use it.
-   Most moves require a particular [[Jobs|job]] or a choice of jobs to be used properly.
    -   When you see the double-bar symbol ∥ it means 'or'. Choose one.
-   The bonuses and difficulties of the roll are all worked out as you read down the move, and should be fairly self-explanatory.
    -   Though some moves also require the right facts to be true, or for events to have unfolded in a certain way, to get the most benefit from them.
-   _You may these [[KISSing|KISS]] move rolls, but remember to keep it short and sweet._

#que See the [[#Social Moves List]] below to read each move separately, or print off the [[social move cards]] from the resources chapter.

#### Exploits

When a move says _“your opponent may exploit you”_ as a failure consequence — which most offensive moves say, for example — this means that your target may choose to take one following responses (as an immediate free action, also called a 'reaction'):

-   **Change Stance:** If they haven't had their turn yet, the target may _change to a different stance_ from the one they chose at the start of the round, without incurring any penalties to their next move.
-   **Deny:** The target bluntly rejects or contradicts you, or cuts down your claim with a simple observation, which staggers your train of thought, counting as a hindrance (_+1 difficulty factor_) to your next move roll (_which can stack with other penalties_).
-   **Shake Off:** If the target is staggered, hesitating, or otherwise hindered, they may shake it off and _remove a penalty or negative status effect_ that's afflicting them.
-   **Raise the Stakes:** The target may may raise the Momentum of the battle for everyone by the margin of failure on your roll against them. They should describe what they do or say in response to you, in proportion to your failure, which gets everyone's attention.
