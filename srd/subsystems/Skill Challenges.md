Similar to DnD skill challenges ...

you must accumulate X total rolls passed before you accumulate 3 total rolls failed

it's a minigame

offer three 'obvious jobs' that could be useful and why, and then allow the players to get creative with their own suggestions and let them justify it. peer review. don't be afraid to say 'no' judiciously

the intent is to get the players to think creatively about how to make use of their jobs

MC's hacks:
1. you have to be trained in the skill to attempt it? (level 3 or higher?) this protects against random job attempts
2. once you make an attempt with one job you can't try that job again (other characters can, but you can't). curbs boring behavior, and encourages cooperation

in each job roll describe how it grants their success in a dramatic way

predetermine what it means to fail each portion: and compare partial to total failure of the whole challenge

track progress with a 'HP bar' or a 'clock' 

it's an attempt to capture a dramatic action sequence and boil it down into a few job rolls

if one character passes you all pass, and progress together, because you're all always helping one another

good for chase sequences, escapes, dungeon crawls, and simplified fights (especially against monsters)

mix it up

it's not vital that every character be able to fully participate (and lead a roll) in every skill challenge, but it's important to mix them up so that over the course of an arc, everyone gets a chance to pull their weight (or got a moment to shine)
