### Experience from Conflict

Instead of tracking your failures during a [[Martial Combat|fight]] or [[Social Discourse|debate]], which would slow down the game's pace, **if you won the conflict then you earn +1 _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_ for each job your rolled with during the scene, and if you lost then you gain +2 _exp_ in each job.** Rolling the job multiple times in the same conflict doesn't matter, just weather or not it was rolled.

**All participants also gain bonus _exp_ equal to the [[Momentum|Momentum Dice]] that the scene ended with, which they can distribute among any of the jobs they used during the scene, however they like.**

‚ùì This bonus exp *can surpass the normal 2 per job per scene maximum* described in the [[Earning Experience]] article.
