##### Ammo Quantities

There are two ways of tracking ammunition quantities: **Limited** and **Unlimited**.

- If you use Limited ammo then you must track your individual bolts, arrows, knives, or bullets, etc. **up to a total maximum of 24 shots**.
- If you use Unlimited ammo then **you will effectively never run out of ammunition** — _unless you make a plan that relies on you never running out of ammunition_ — but this costs you +1 [[Carry Weight|carry weight]], for the extra bulk.

**In other words:** If the Unlimited ammo rules start getting abused, or if you want a more realistic [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]], then the [[Facilitator|FC]] may impose more limited ammo quantities.
