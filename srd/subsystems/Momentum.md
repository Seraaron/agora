## Momentum

**Momentum is a value that affects the whole conflict and everyone in it:** As Momentum increases past _[[#Momentum Dice|certain thresholds]]_, your offensive moves get more potent — as the tension escalates, things become more fraught, and your mishaps get more costly!

**Conflicts start at _zero_ Momentum.** Unless the conflict is happening in a scene _immediately following_ another conflict (in which case the starting Momentum is _half_ of the previous conflict's final Momentum, rounded up).

**Momentum has the potential to rise with every combatant's turn!** The amount it rises will depend on their chosen stance or tone, and may raise further during their turn depending on which move they choose. You can also raise Momentum on an opponent's turn with the 'Raise the Stakes' exploit.

**When the _Momentum equals or exceeds your Disposition_ you are no longer protected by the difference, and finishing moves will be easier to use on you.** You are fairly vulnerable from that point onward, and you would do well to either try to end the conflict as quickly as possible, recover some [[Social Discourse#Presence|Presence]] or [[Martial Combat#Poise|Poise]], or make a hasty retreat.

**In other words:** Once Momentum is high enough, if you don't finish things on your own terms as quickly as possible, then* someone else probably will*.

#### Momentum Dice

**At Momentum 5, and every 10 Momentum thereafter, everyone in the conflict gains a constant +1 bonus die to _every offensive move_**. These are called 'Momentum Dice', or **+MD** in the move descriptions to remind you of them.

| Momentum: | 0-4 | 5-14 | 15-24 | 25-34 | 35-44 | 45-50* |
| --------: | :-: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----: |
|   **MD:** |  +0 |  +1  |   +2  |   +3  |   +4  |   +5   |

#asterisk **At Momentum 50** — should the conflict somehow last that long — everyone gets too exhausted to continue arguing or fighting effectively. _The MD stays at +5_, but Momentum stops increasing any further, and anyone still standing takes a **random point of temporary stress** *at the beginning of every round* thereafter until they either pass out, surrender, or walk away.

The  '[[Agora Momentum Grid.pdf|Momentum Grid]]' also clearly shows the current +MD in each cell:

> ### Nb.
> We recommend that you use the [[Agora Momentum Grid.pdf|Momentum Grid]] — for both [[Social Discourse|social]] and [[Martial Combat|martial]] conflicts— to track everyone's Dispositions as well, and also to clearly present the turn order, using personalized tokens or miniatures.
>
> The grid is useful because your Disposition can change frequently over the course of the debate, and it's generally quicker and easier to simply move a token than it is to repeatedly write, scrub out, and rewrite a number.
