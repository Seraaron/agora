### Momentum

**Momentum is a value that affects the whole conflict and everyone in it:** As Momentum increases past _[[#Momentum Dice|certain thresholds]]_, your moves get more potent; as the tension escalates, things become more fraught, and your mishaps get more costly!

-   **Conflicts start at zero Momentum.**
    -   Unless the conflict is happening in a scene _immediately following_ another conflict (in which case the starting Momentum is _half_ of the previous conflict's final Momentum, rounded down).
-   **Momentum has the potential to rise with every combatant's turn!**
    -   The amount it rises will depend on their chosen stance, and their successes from a simple [[Checks|ability check]], and may raise further during their turn depending on which move they choose.
        -   **Momentum dice cannot be [[KISSing|KISSed]]** though.
    -   You can also raise Momentum on an opponent's turn with the 'Raise the Stakes' exploit.
-   **When the _Momentum equals or exceeds your [[Social Discourse#Composure|Composure]] or [[Martial Combat#Stamina|Stamina]]_ you are no longer protected by the difference, and the [[Dismiss]] or [[Pacify]] moves will be easier to use on you, respectively.**
    -   You are fairly vulnerable from that point onward, and you would do well to either try to end the conflict as quickly as possible, recover some [[Social Discourse#Presence|Presence]] or [[Martial Combat#Poise|Poise]], or make a hasty retreat.

**In other words:** Once Momentum is high enough, if you don't finish things on your own terms as quickly as possible, then* someone else probably will*.

#### Momentum Dice

**Every 10 Momentum, everyone in the conflict gains a constant +1 bonus die to _every offensive move_**. These are called 'Momentum Dice', or **+MD** in the move descriptions to remind you of them.

| Momentum: | 0-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-59 |  60 |
| --------: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :-: |
|   **MD:** |  +0 |   +1  |   +2  |   +3  |   +4  |   +5  |  ⁎  |

**At Momentum 60** — should the conflict somehow last that long — everyone gets too exhausted to continue arguing or fighting effectively. _The MD stays at +5_, but **everyone left standing starts taking a random point of stress every round**, until they either call it a draw and walk away, fall unconscious, or finish off their last opponent.

The  '[[Agora Momentum Grid.pdf|Momentum Grid]]' also clearly shows the current +MD in each cell:

> We recommend that you use the [[Agora Momentum Grid.pdf|Momentum Grid]] — for both [[Social Discourse|social]] and [[Martial Combat|martial]] conflicts— to track everyone's Composure / Stamina as well, and also to clearly present the turn order, using personalized tokens or miniatures.
>
> The grid is useful because your Composure / Stamina can change frequently over the course of the debate, and it's generally quicker and easier to simply move a token than it is to repeatedly write, scrub out, and rewrite a number.
