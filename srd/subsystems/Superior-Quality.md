Superior-quality items grant **+2 bonus dice** to all rolls made with them. This makes them a lot more expensive, but also easier to maintain and repair. You will find that superior quality items are jealously guarded, forged by masters, usually aren't directly for sale (or only sold to exclusive buyers), or must be traded for extensive favors. Superior quality items are also usually *named*.
