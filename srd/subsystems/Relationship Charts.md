#### Relationship Charts

[[Links]] helps you to build up networks allies and enemies all with connections to each other for different reasons. It can be useful to make a relationship chart if Links is being used regularly enough.

To do this, write the names of all the [[Player Characters]], [[VINPCs]], and [[Non-player Characters*|other recurring characters]] that have been introduced to the campaign on a big sheet of paper. Put the names roughly in a circle, but leave some space to add more names later on. *Then:*

- Draw colored or stylized lines between their names to indicate different types of relationships: _Friend, Lover, Family, Rival, Enemy, Mentor, etc._
- Label the lines and use arrows to indicate recent actions that one character has taken towards the other: _Employed, Defended, Attacked, Killed, Imprisoned, Freed, Encouraged, Flirted, Betrayed, etc._
- Draw a star around a name to indicate that they're a PC.
- Circle a name to indicate they're a VINPC, and underline them if they're someone's [[VINPCs#Kith Kin|Kith or Kin]].
- Cross out a character's name to indicate a death.

Eventually, you'll be able to look back at the relationship chart and see a great web of interactions: plots and schemes, story threads, funny interactions, and so on. It will tell a story all by itself, or remind you of things you may have forgotten.

‚ùó We recommend drawing a fresh relationship chart every [[Campaign Arcs|arc]] for particularly roleplay heavy campaigns.
