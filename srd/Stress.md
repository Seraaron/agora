## Stress

Stress is a temporary penalty that can be applied to any [[Abilities|ability]] (and some [[Capabilities|capabilities]]). When you gain stress, fill in the respective diamond for that ability (ie. ◇◇ → ◆◇ → ◆◆) on your [character sheet](#charsheet).

Each ability stress is tracked independently — representing unique aches or adversities imposed on different parts of your mind or body — _but their mechanical effects are all the same:_ **You _roll one die fewer_ on all rolls using that ability for each point of stress**, up to a maximum penalty of −2.

Points of stress can come _hard and fast!_ They are most commonly gained for an ability as a failure condition on a [[Stressful Rolls|stressful roll]], but they can also be given out as general consequences (ie. regardless of success or failure), or simply by interacting with the world or the environment in certain ways, or applied like 'status effects' from drugs or spells.

#que Should you gain stress in an ability but already be full (ie. at ◆◆), then your [[Peers]] may choose *the next most appropriate ability* for you to gain stress in instead.

### Stress Kills!

**If the stress diamonds of _all six core abilities_ are completely filled then you will fall unconscious**. You can wake up a few hours later, still at 12 stress, but if you don't take some time off and start treating your stress soon then the next time you suffer stress you'll lose a point of [[Health]] and _gain a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]] instead_. **If you have no Health remaining then you will die!**

### Remedies for Stress

Removing stress requires that you perform one of the activities listed as a 'remedy' for that ability's stress.

-   This usually costs time or money, or both, and can only be done in a safe environment.
-   Special items or spells may also remedy certain stresses, and these can be used anywhere.

**Once a remedy is performed, all the stress on that ability may be removed**; but you can only perform _one remedy per day_ (without using magic or advanced technologies). This limit means you may have to make tough decisions about which stress to prioritize removing if you are on a tight schedule.

Alternatively, if there is a [[Downtime and Travel|downtime skip]] of more than a week then all stresses on your character sheet are reduced by one, or _all stress is removed entirely_ if the timeskip is longer than a month.

#### Pushing Through It

You can **temporarily ignore a point of physical stress** *until the end of a scene* by using a [[Medic]] roll on yourself, or you can do the same with a [[Nurse]] roll on mental stresses. The difficulty of this roll is equal to your total accumulated stress across all of your abilities (including any that has been pushed through).

Alternatively, you can perform the same roll on another character, to temporarily relieve them of their stress. 

**At the end of the scene:** The stress comes back, and in the same ability it was in before. If you've acquired more stress since then, and the bar for that ability is now filled, then the returning stress can spill over into other related ability instead!

#que This is process is effectively the same as using the [[Treat]] move outside of a conflict, without any bonuses from the heat of the moment.

### The Core Stresses
The stresses for the six core [[Abilities|abilities]] are called: **[[#Worry]]**, **[[#Burnout]]**, **[[#Confusion]]**, **[[#Shock]]**, **[[#Fatigue]]**, and **[[#Pain]]**. These names are just to help distinguish them from one another, and to prompt you to roleplay a certain way before you get remedied. *They also inform you about what the remedies might involve.*

###### Stress Relieving Scenes

Stress can be utilized in two ways: Mechanically, it is a simply resource for [[Facilitator|Facilitators]] to tax and for players to manage. But narratively it can produce some deeply cathartic story moments. 

Depending on the pace and [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]] of your game, these sorts of [[Session Structure#Scenes|scenes]] can be short and simple or long and personal. If stress is occurring frequently (especially from adventuring or combat) then recovery time might start eating up a lot of precious session time, in which case it's probably better to skip them and just say that a week passes. Alternatively, if stress is quite rare in your game then it may be worth giving a remedy scene the time it deserves and *embrace the feeling of [ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_%28negative_space%29)* 間 (or 'emptiness') that it creates...

Certain stresses, like [[Shock|shock]] and [[Burnout|burnout]], can generate miniature [[Campaign Arcs#Character Arcs|character arcs]] all by themselves. So we encourage you to experiment, play, and let it pass through you. You might just surprise yourself!
