## Stress

Stress is a temporary penalty that can be applied to any [[Abilities|ability]] (and some [[Capabilities|capabilities]]). When you gain stress, fill in the respective diamond for that ability (ie. ◇◇ → ◆◇ → ◆◆) on your [character sheet](#charsheet).

Each ability has its own unique stress in _name and remedy_ — representing an adversity or ache imposed on your mind or body, or resources — _but their mechanical effects are all the same:_

>#nb
>**You _roll one die fewer_ on all [[Checks]] and [[Tasks]] using that ability for each point of stress** (to a maximum of −2 dice).

Points of stress can come _hard and fast!_ They are usually gained for an ability as a failure condition on a roll, but they can also be given out as general consequences (ie. regardless of success or failure), or simply by interacting with the world or the environment in certain ways, or applied like 'status effects' from drugs or spells.

#que Should you gain stress in an ability but already be full (ie. at ◆◆), then your [[Peers]] may choose *the next most appropriate ability* for you to gain stress in instead.

### Stress Kills!

**If the stress diamonds of _all six core abilities_ are filled then you will die**, unless you then [[Health#Cheating Death|spend Health to cheat death]]; in which case _you gain a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]] instead_. You must still seek a remedy as soon as possible, when this happens, as your stress is not removed.

With this in mind, you can almost consider your core stresses to be an abstract 'life bar' — if you combined all twelve stress diamonds into a single track — but from your character's perspective, stress is just part of the hand they're dealt.

### Remedies for Stress

Removing stress requires that you perform some or all of the activities listed below as a 'remedies' for that ability:

-   This usually costs time or money, or both, and can only be done in a safe environment.
-   Special items or spells may also remedies certain debilitations, and these can be used anywhere.

**Once a remedy is performed, all the stress on that ability may be removed**; but you can only perform _one remedy per day_ (without using magic or advanced technologies). This limit means you may have to make tough decisions about which stress to prioritize removing if you are on a tight schedule.

Alternatively, if there is a [[Campaign structure#Downtime|downtime skip]] of more than a week then all stresses on your character sheet are reduced by one, or _all stress is removed entirely_ if the timeskip is longer than a month.

### The Core Stresses

The stresses for the six core [[Abilities|abilities]] are called: **[[#Worry]]** (App), **[[#Fatigue]]** (Res), **[[#Confusion]]** (Wit), **[[#Shock]]** (Fin), **[[#Hunger]]** (End), and **[[#Pain]]** (Swi). These names are just to help distinguish them from one another, and to prompt you to roleplay a certain way before you get remedied. *They also inform you about what the remedies might involve.*
