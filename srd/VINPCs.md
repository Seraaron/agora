## VINPCs

VINPC — pronounced /vɪn·pi·si/ — stands for '**Very Important Non-Player Character**'.

They are a type of [[Non-player Characters|Non-player Character]] that [[Facilitator|Facilitators]] and [[Player Characters]] alike can make use of. Players can designate VINPCs using their [[#Kith and Kin]] slots on their [character sheets](#unfinished), and Facilitators can keep a short list of their most important or recurring characters on hand to bring out when needed.

#### The 'VINPC' Designation does Two Things:

1. **Highlights their importance** to the story in general or significance to an individual Player Character.
2. **Marks them as 'essential'** to a player. Meaning they won't randomly die and can't be killed without that player's explicit permission.

### Kith & Kin

All [[Player Characters]] may choose or create _up to three_ NPCs that they wish to mark as being VINPCs. This is done by writing their name and their relationship to you in one of the three boxes on your [character sheet](#charsheet).

> ### Nb.
>
> If you don't fill all your VINPC slots during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] then don't worry, you can designate someone you meet during a session as a VINPC instead — signaling to your FC that you like this character and want to see them more often in play — making them significant to your character's life.

**Kith and kin can always be found in the world, simply by asking your FC if you can go and talk to them**. The only restrictions against this notion are common sense ones, like them being too far away, in a place you don't have easy access to, or some other current preoccupation.

**Similarly, your kith and kin will never betray you**, unless you push them too far and have a [[#Falling Out|falling out]] (see below).

❓ You don't need to list other PCs as kith or kin, _even if they're literally members of your character's family_.  Though your allied party members can also be reached at any time using this same ruling.

#### Three per Player

**Three is the maximum number of VINPCs that each player can have**, and only the FC can change this limit — since they will be the one playing all of these characters, for the most part.

You can change out your kith and kin for other NPCs during any [[Development Sessions|development session]], if you feel that someone has lost relevance to the current direction of the story or a new friend or family member has shown up and suddenly become important to you.

##### Unusual VINPCs

**A VINPC may be an animal companion, an ethereal guardian, or even a sapient object.** _You can get very creative with the kith and kin rules if you want to._

#### Favor

Each kith and kin entry has a diamond next to them called 'favor'. This diamond should be filled (ie. ◇ → ◆) representing when you _gain_ favor, and erased (ie. ◆ → ◇) when you _spend_ that favor. Favor is a metacurrency of sorts, a bit like [[Kismet]], but for individual VINPCs.

> ##### Spending Favor:
>
> - To ask for [[Helping|help]] on a roll, tying them to the [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]] of your actions.
> - To borrow an [[Assets and Gear|asset or piece of gear]] for a scene —  though damaging it, losing it, or stealing it may negatively affect your relationship.
> - To use a [[Gambits|gambit]] or [[magical subsystem|spell]] for you, to _tell you a secret_, or do anything else that is within their power.
> - To come with you somewhere they wouldn't normally go, making them available to talk to and present in scenes that they otherwise wouldn't be (or shouldn't be).
>
> _And your Facilitator may come up with other unique ways that you can spend favor too, which may be specific to that individual._

**If you currently lack favor** and want them to do any of these things for you, then you must persuade, bribe, or manipulate them like any other NPC.

❗ Not having favor doesn't mean they suddenly hate you, it just means they're unwilling to aid you without recompense or a good reason.

❓ And what's considered 'reasonable' can change from NPC to NPC, by the discretion of your Facilitator.

##### Regaining Favor

Favor refills in two ways:

- **Returning the favor** — in this sense, _when you spend favor, that NPC 'gains favor' with you instead_, which they may spend on you in all of the same ways as you can on them by offering their favor back in return.
- **Giving them a gift** — but not just _any_ gift. It must be something that you know they need or want, or something they will truly enjoy and treasure. It doesn't need to be a physical gift either, it could be information or the bestowing of an honor. _Ask your FC, or make a roll, and get creative!_

When you first start a new game, make an Appeal [[Checks|check]] for each character listed as kith or kin to see if you start with their favor or not (requiring 2 successes). If you _don't_ have their favor, then think about _'why not?'_ and tell your FC.

#### Falling Out

If you abuse your relationship with a VINPC then you may lose more than just favor with them. **Your FC can remove them from your character sheet if you push them too far, effectively retiring them from the story**.

Or — if it makes sense to the FC to do this — they can instead become a _rival_ whom you frequently meet and come into conflict with from then onward.

❗ In either case, the NPC in question won't return to your kith and kin list until you can redeem yourself in their eyes.

> ### Nb.
>
> There is no solid 'gauge' for this, exactly — so that the system _cannot be "gamed"_ — but **your FC should always warn you** if they feel your relationship with a VINPC is waning.

#### Bereavement Protection

A character that you designate as kith or kin cannot be killed by anyone, or they cannot die circumstantially without your _out-of-game permission_. The key _as always_ is to keep an open forum with your [[Peers]].

###### Non-diegetic Immunity

On the surface, these restrictions about VINPC death and betrayal may seem artificial or immersion-breaking — and, in some ways, they are — but they don't _really_ grant the character immortality or make them unwaveringly loyal. The system just functions as an extra [[Script Change Tools|consent mechanic]], to reassure the players that characters they care about won't have some tragedy befall them that wasn't clearly signaled beforehand.
