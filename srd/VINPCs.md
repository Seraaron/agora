## VINPCs

VINPC — pronounced /vɪn·pi·si/ — stands for 'Very Important Non-Player Character', and they are a type of [[Non-player Characters|Non-player Character]] that [[Facilitator|Facilitators]] and [[Player Characters]] alike can make use of. Players can designate VINPCs using their [[#Kith and Kin]] slots on their [character sheets](#unfinished), and Facilitators can keep a short list of their most important or recurring characters on hand to bring out when needed.

##### The VINPC designation does two main things:

1.  **Highlights their importance** to the story in general or significance to an individual Player Character.
2.  **Marks them as 'essential'**. Meaning they won't randomly die and can't be killed without that player's explicit permission.

### Kith & Kin

All [[Player Characters]] may choose or make up NPCs that they wish to mark as being VINPCs. This is done by writing their name and their relationship to you in one of the three boxes on your [character sheet](#charsheet).

> #nb
> If you don't fill all your VINPC slots during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] then don't worry, you can designate someone you meet during a session as a VINPC instead a — if you find that you like them — signaling to your FC that you like this character and want to see them more often in play, making them significant to your character's life.

**Kith and kin can always be found in the world, simply by asking your FC if you can go and talk to them**. The only restrictions against this notion are common sense ones, like them being too far away, in a place you don't have easy access to, or otherwise currently unavailable. **Similarly, kith and kin will never betray you**, unless you push them too far ([[#Falling Out|see below]]).

#que You shouldn't list other PCs as kith or kin, even if they're literally members of your character's family; but functionally _your allied party members can also be reached at any time using this rule_.

#### Three per Player

**Three is the maximum** number of VINPCs that a player can have, _and only the FC can change this limit_ since they will be the one playing all of these characters, for the most part. You can change out your kith and kin for other NPCs during any [[Development Sessions|development session]], if you feel that someone has lost relevance to the current direction of the story or a new friend or family member has shown up and suddenly become important to you.

Similarly, a VINPC may be an animal companion, an ethereal guardian, or even a sapient object. _You can get very creative with the kith and kin rules if you want to._

#### Favor

Each kith and kin entry has a diamond next to them called 'favor'. This diamond should be filled (ie. ◇ → ◆) representing when you _gain_ favor, and erased (ie. ◆ → ◇) when you _spend_ that favor. Favor is a metacurrency of sorts, a bit like [[Kismet]], but for individual VINPCs.

> ##### Favor can be spent in four main ways:
> 
> -   To ask for [[Helping|help]] on a roll, tying them to the [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]] of your actions.
> -   To borrow an [[Assets and Gear|asset or piece of gear]] for a scene (though damaging it, losing it, or stealing it will negatively affect your relationship).
> -   To use a [[Gambits|gambit]] for you, tell you a secret, or do anything else that is within their power.
> -   To come with you somewhere they wouldn't normally go, making them available to talk to and present in scenes that they otherwise wouldn't be.
> 
> _And your Facilitator may come up with other unique ways that you can spend favor too, which may be specific to that individual._

**If you currently lack favor** and want them to do any of these things for you, then you must persuade, bribe, or manipulate them like any other NPC.

#imp Not having favor doesn't mean they suddenly hate you, it just means they're unwilling to aid you without recompense or a good reason.

#que And what's considered 'reasonable' can change from NPC to NPC, by the discretion of your Facilitator.

##### Regaining Favor

Favor refills in two ways:

-   **Returning the favor** — in this sense, _when you spend favor, that NPC 'gains favor' with you instead_, which they may 'spend' on you in all of the same ways as you can on them by offering their favor back in return.
-   **Giving them a gift** — but not just _any_ gift. It must be something that you know they need or want, or something they will truly enjoy and treasure. It doesn't need to be a physical gift either, it could be information or the bestowing of an honor. Ask your FC, or make a roll, and get creative!

When you first start a new game, make a *normal* Appeal [[Checks|check]] for each character listed as kith or kin to see if you start with their favor or not. If you _don't_ have their favor, then think about ‘why not?’ and tell your FC.

#### Falling Out

If you abuse your relationship with a VINPC then you may lose more than just favor with them: Your FC can remove them for your character sheet if you push them too far, effectively retiring them from the story. 

Or — if it makes sense to the FC to do this — they can instead become a _rival_ whom you frequently meet and come into conflict with from then onward. In either case, the NPC in question won't return to your kith and kin list until you can redeem yourself in their eyes.

> #nb
> There is no solid 'gauge' for this, exactly — so that the system _cannot be "gamed"_ — but **your FC should always warn you** if they feel your relationship with a VINPC is waning.

##### Bereavement Protection

A character that you designate as kith or kin cannot be killed by anyone, or they cannot die circumstantially without your _out-of-game permission_. The key, as always, is to keep an open forum with your [[Peers]].

###### Non-diegetic Immunity

On the surface, these restrictions about VINPC death and betrayal may seem artificial or immersion-breaking — and, in some ways, they are — but they don't _really_ grant the character immortality or make them unwaveringly loyal though; the system just functions as an extra [[Script Change Tools|consent mechanic]], to reassure the players that characters they care about won't have some tragedy befall them that wasn't clearly signaled beforehand.
