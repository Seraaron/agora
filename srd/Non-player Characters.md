# Non-Player Characters

- npcs are like 'barrowed cars'. you can take care of them for a while, using them when you need to, or take them for a joy ride, but you can't really keep them, so don't get too attached

#### what is an npc?

- npcs have motivations, different from a location or a trap or a generic combat encounter
- they are dynamic and want stuff (and the stuff they want can change)
- not just stat blocks
	- but many different npcs can be built off of the same stat block
- they can be completely self interested and can act prompty without forethought
- they don't need to be complicated
- try to have npcs relate to individual pcs, rather than to the whole party
- npcs with no agency might as well be signposts
- for vinpcs, think mass effect not skyrim
- as soon as you work out everything about an npc (their stats, backstory, future plot threads, etc) they stop being an npc and basically become a pc
- 
#### making npcs plausible
- npcs are an opportunity to convey a point of view
	- or can be used as foils against the players
- you need to know their motivation and their personality, ie
	- what do they want?
	- how do they express themselves?
- less is often more 

- you don't have to have a npc fully fleshed out, you can discover them as you play

##### lying (or misinformed) npcs 

#### making npcs memorable

##### doing voices
- you kinda just have to go for it
	- be willing to feel a bit foolish
	- but then you'll get into it
- it can make everyone else feel more comfortable and unafraid to make a fool of themselves too

###### mannerisms vs accents

- you can do a lot to affect personality by just changing the pace at which you speak, using a different vocal register, and choosing to use different vocabularies and grammar or a variety of phrases and slang
	- (for example, by never using contractions, or using 'ye olde english' enunciations, or by employing a particular character trait)
- accents occur in two main ways:
	- one cultural group learns the languages of another cultural group, but there's certain sounds that they're just not used to saying or distinguishing a difference between
	- a cultural group gets isolated from it's parent and sounds shift without anyone noticing until those communities meet again
	- in a fantasy or sci-fi setting accents can also come from just having different physiology to make noises with
- accents aren't stereotypes *by themselves*, but they can come with baggage which you should be aware of

---

- ultimately, what you're trying to do by doing voices is make it easier for the players to audibly distinguish between which NPC is talking in any given scene
	- as long as you can make that clear, you don't actually have to be consistent
- learning to do 'good accents' is a skill in and of itself, completely separate from being a goof facilitator, so having said that:

#### You don't have to speak in character all the time

### Monsters

"Monsters" are unreasonable and unambigiously Evil. They may be sentient, and may even capable of mimicry or speech, but they are not *sapient* (or they have lost their sense of sapiency) and are therefore unplayable.   

### Bosses

### Mobs

### Animals vs Beasts
