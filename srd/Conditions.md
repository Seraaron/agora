# Conditions

Conditions are features that represent some aspect of your self that you're still working through, or learning how to deal with. They may be physical, mental, social, or even spiritual in nature.

> #eg
> They may be the remnants of old wounds (ie. [[Wounds and Scars|scars]]); life-long disabilities or freshly discovered ones; compulsive behaviors or addictions; recurring nightmares; or even some _seemingly trivial_ things like allergies or phobias.

They are not inherently 'good' or 'bad', they're just part of who you are, and sometimes they can get in the way of your life at inopportune moments, handicapping them (though, you decide when those moments occur).

### Applying Conditions

Aside from helping you to roleplay, and perhaps encouraging you to try and represent something outside of your normal comfort zone, conditions can cause problems for you when you come to roll dice:

**Each condition may be applied against you for an appropriate roll, once per session, raising the difficulty of that roll by *reducing the number of dice you roll by 1***. Similar to [[Stress|stress]], but only applied for a single roll.

#imp Any of your [[Peers]] may _suggest_ that that particular condition should be applied, _but the choice to apply it is ultimately yours alone_.

#### Resulting Kismet
If you apply a condition and:
- **Succeed at the roll in spite of the penalty**, then you will regain [[Ego]].
- **Fail the roll**, or fail to fulfill your agenda, then you gain a [[Lots|Lot]] instead.

You should then _continue to roleplay appropriately for the remainder of that scene_, or for as long as you feel comfortable, in whatever way you feel is appropriate to your interpretation of that condition.

Once a condition has been used, lightly fill in the circle symbol next to it on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] (ie. ◯ → ⬤). Then erase all the filled circles at the end of the session, so your they're fresh for next time.

### Earning and Removing Conditions

You can take one condition from your [[Archtype]] choice, for free, and up to two more can be rolled for or chosen from the [[D666 Conditions|conditions list]] for free. Any more than three must be bought, using 'caps', during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]]. Beyond that, you can get scars during play from [[#Wounds and Scars|being wounded]], and you can also earn new conditions during a [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|feature vote]].

The conditions found in the [[D666 Conditions]] list are literally just words or short phrases, with no preset definition or suggested uses, so new conditions can be created on the fly quite easily, with approval from [[Peers|your Peers]].

Ultimately, the interpretation of their meaning and the application of the mechanics are left to you, the owner; _the one who has to live with it._

#### Catharsis

_Once per condition_ **when you allow yourself to be vulnerable in a way that relates to one of your conditions** put a tick mark ✓ next to it on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], and tell your [[Peers]] that you've done this; indicating that you're ready to move on from it.

> #eg 
> - You tell the tale to someone about how you got a particular scar and escaped with your life.
> - You take an opportunity to vent about hard it can be to live with your condition.
> - You realize that you've been behaving in a toxic way, find someone to apologize to who's been affected by that behavior, and are forgiven.
> - You open up about your traumatic experiences with someone you trust in an intimate moment.
> - You generally just feel healed and rejuvenated, or validated, and ready to find your new self.

From then onward, at any time afterwards, **you can regain your [[Ego]]** by _spending that tick_ and either changing the condition to become a [[Circumstances|circumstance]], or erasing it entirely from your character sheet.

#imp Catharsis does not necessarily 'cure' you of a given condition — more likely, it's a recognition that you've learned to cope with it, and can metaphorically _move on_ from it — the baggage stays with you, but you're stronger for it.

###### Why are conditions like this?

It is fairly commonly knowledge these days that the same medical condition can affect different people in many different ways, but less well-known is that a single condition can affect the same person in many different ways _over time_. **Handicaps are neither uniform nor universal**. Additionally, not all conditions are medical in nature, some just relate to your personality.

The lows of a character's journey can be just as important in a story as their highs, though. By using a more hands-off approach — _giving the players the power to apply their own penalties as they see fit_ and _rewarding them for it when they do_ — not only makes the consequences sting a little less, it makes sure that the overcoming of personal adversity can be incorporated into the game in a way that can be empowering in it's own right too.

#### Limits for Conditions

-   Each condition can only earn you [[Lots]] or [[Ego]] once per session.
-   You cannot stack multiple condition penalties on the same roll.
-   Once used, you should try to roleplay through the condition appropriately for at least the rest of the scene.
-   You may only have six 'active' conditions at any one time.
	-   Should you gain another one _while at six_ then decide which one is more important, and shelve one of them until there's space again.
-   The catharsis mechanic can effectively be used to 'bank' Ego, but these are _single use_ and unique events, and their narrative weight should be emphasized over their benefit to the game system.


##### Returning Conditions

Some conditions can *come back*, even after experiencing catharsis with them, but this is rare, should be agreed upon by [[Peers|your Peers]], and can only occur once per [[Campaign Arcs|arc]].

###### Suffering and Trauma in Roleplaying Games

Roleplaying games can be a _tremendously powerful tool_ for exploring deeply personal topics, for going on journeys of self-discovery, and for generally improving your mental well-being. The psychotherapeutic effects of these games are still being discovered, but I'm not qualified to write about them. Still, it's important to emphasize that _your friends are not your psychiatrists_, and you should think of them as such.

This entire article deals with topics that may be sensitive to some readers. In fact, some players may not wish to deal with these aspects in their game at all. Therefore, _conditions are a completely ignorable mechanic_. **You don't have to take any conditions that you don't want.**

As always, it's important to go over your [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] with your group before you begin play, and to make sure that no one is playing with a condition that may make others feel uneasy, or that no one receives a wound or a scar that makes them genuinely unhappy or frightened, and that no other topics come up which could fracture your friendship over the game.
