# Conditions

Conditions are features that represent some aspect of your self that you're still working through, or learning how to deal with. They may be physical, mental, social, or even spiritual in nature.

> ### Eg.
>
> They may be the remnants of old wounds; life-long disabilities or freshly discovered ones; compulsive behaviors or addictions; recurring nightmares; strange personality traits or idiosyncrasies; magical curses; or even some _seemingly trivial_ things like allergies or phobias.

They are not inherently 'good' or 'bad', they're just part of who you are. Sometimes they can get in the way of your character's life at inopportune moments, handicapping them (though, you decide when those moments occur). Othertimes they can be beneficial quirks, highlighting things that others may miss or take for granted.

## Applying Conditions

Aside from helping you to roleplay, and perhaps encouraging you to try and represent something outside of your normal comfort zone, each condition can be used _once per session_ to make trade-offs when you come to roll dice — positive or negative.

❗ You can only use **one condition per roll**, at most, _for or against_.

### Using them to your Benefit

When you feel a condition should be counted as a blessing, _or at least a silver lining_, and you can incorporate the presence of the condition into the way you roleplay: **You may _spend a [[Lots|Lot]]_ and gain bonus dice for an upcoming roll equal to your current [[Health]]**.

You will occasionally need to justify the use of a condition to your [[Peers]] if it's not clear to them how a certain condition might be helpful. Still, *try to be creative with how you interpret your various conditions*.

❓ This is quite similar to how you may have to justify your [[KISSing|KISSes]]. If you start '[[KISSing#No Tongue|tonguing it]]', or overuse the same descriptions, then you can be overruled.

### Using them to your Deficit

When you feel that a condition should handicap you, *or cause momentary stress*, and you roleplay appropriately: **You will suffer an −1 die penalty to an upcoming roll but you'll also immediately regain [[Ego]]**.

This primarily a *roleplaying decision*. By allowing yourself to slip up, to indulge a flaw, or to simply accept that you're at a disadvantage, it makes your character more believable if they fail for realistic reasons. When their imperfections are accentuated for all the world to see.

❗ Any of your [[Peers]] may _suggest_ that that particular condition should be applied, _but the choice to negatively impact your own rolls in this way is ultimately yours alone_.

#### Choosing to Fail Completely

You may find this is true even for rolls where you don't have an applicable condition: *That you actually want to fail*. **Usually for story reasons.** In this case, you can simply tell your [[Peers]] and see how they respond.

This can only occur once per session, but if your [[Facilitator|FC]] agrees that it's appropriate, you may regain [[Ego]] as compensation.

❓ Failure still has [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]], even if you chose that failure for yourself.

### Once per Session per Condition

Once used, in either of the two ways above, **put a checkmark ✓ in the circle next to the condition's name on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]]**. Then erase all the checkmarks at the end of the session, during [[Wrap Up|wrap up]], so they're fresh for next time.

## Catharsis

_Once per condition_, **when you allow yourself to be vulnerable in a way that relates to one of your conditions, you may _cross it out on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]]_** — _indicating that you're ready to move on from it._

**Then at any time afterwards, you can regain your [[Ego]] by _erasing the condition from your character sheet entirely!_**

_Alternatively:_ If you want to keep some remnant of it, or not forget that you had it, then you can list the spent condition as a [[Circumstances|circumstance]] instead.

> ### Eg.
>
> - You tell the tale to someone about how you got a particular scar and escaped with your life.
> - You take an opportunity to vent about hard it can be to live with your condition.
> - You realize that you've been behaving in a toxic way, find someone to apologize to who's been affected by that behavior, and are forgiven.
> - You open up about your traumatic experiences with someone you trust in an intimate moment.
> - You generally just feel healed and rejuvenated, or validated, and ready to find your new self.

❓ Catharsis does not necessarily 'cure' you of a given condition — more likely, it's a recognition that you've learned to cope with it and you can _move on_ from it — the baggage stays with you, but you're stronger for it.

❗ The catharsis mechanic can effectively be used to 'bank' Ego, but these are _single use_ and unique events, and their narrative weight should be emphasized over their benefit to the game system.

###### Why are conditions like this?

It is fairly commonly knowledge these days that the same medical condition can affect different people in different ways, but less well-known is that the same condition can affect the same person in different ways _over time_. **Handicaps are neither uniform nor universal**. Additionally, not all conditions are medical in nature, some just relate to your personality or backstory.

The lows of a character's journey can be just as important in a story as their highs, though. By using a more hands-off approach — _giving the players the power to apply their own penalties as they see fit_ and _rewarding them for it when they do_ — not only makes the consequences sting a little less, it makes sure that the overcoming of personal adversity can be incorporated into the game in a way that can be empowering in it's own right too.

As always, it's important to go over your [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] with your group before you begin play. This ensures that no one is playing with a condition that may make others feel uneasy, or that no one receives a wound or a scar that makes them genuinely unhappy or frightened, and that no other topics come up which could fracture your friendship over the game.

## Earning Conditions

Characters start with a few conditions from the [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] process, for free. Additional conditions must be bought using [[Caps Menu#Condition Costs|caps]] (8¢ each). **Though, you don't have to take any conditions that you don't want.**

Beyond that, you can **get scars during play from [[#Wounds and Scars|being wounded]]**, and you can also **earn new conditions during a [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|feature vote]]**.

**A character can have up to six 'active' conditions.** If you have acquired more than six, you'll need to choose which ones are available for you to use at the start of each session. 

❓ You can play without _any_ conditions, if you prefer, but you'll be missing out on a fairly key aspect of the core game.

### Returning Conditions

Some conditions can _come back_, even after experiencing [[#Catharsis]] with them; but this is rare, should be agreed upon by [[Peers|your Peers]], and _can only occur once per [[Campaign Arcs|arc]]_.

### Making New Conditions

The conditions found in the [[D666 Conditions|random conditions table]] are literally just words or short phrases, with no preset definition or suggested uses, so new conditions can be created on the fly quite easily, with approval from [[Peers|your Peers]].

**Ultimately, the interpretation of a condition's meaning and the application of its mechanics are left to you, the owner** — _the one who has to live with it._
