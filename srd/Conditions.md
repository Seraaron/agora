# Conditions

Conditions are features that represent some aspect of your self that you're still working through, or learning how to deal with. They may be physical, mental, or spiritual in nature.

> #eg
> They may be the remnants of old wounds (ie. Scars); life-long disabilities or freshly discovered ones; compulsive behaviors or addictions; recurring nightmares; or even some _seemingly trivial_ things like allergies or phobias.

They generally make your character's life more difficult at inopportune moments, handicapping them (though, you decide when those moments occur).

### Applying Conditions

Aside from helping you to roleplay, and perhaps encouraging you to try and represent something outside of your normal comfort zone, conditions can cause problems for you when you come to roll dice:

Each condition may be applied against you, once per session, _raising the difficulty of a roll by one step_. That is:

|     On a Check     |       On a Task      |
| :----------------: | :------------------: |
|    Easy → Normal   | +1 difficulty factor |
|    Normal → Hard   |                      |
| Hard → Impossible* |                      |

#ast Automatic failure without using a [[Specialties|specialty]] or spending [[Ego]].

#imp Any of your [[Peers]] may _suggest_ that that particular condition should be applied, _but the choice to apply it is ultimately yours alone_.

If you apply a condition and you **then proceed to succeed at the roll in spite of the penalty**, then you will regain [[Ego]]! If you fail, then you gain a [[Lots|Lot]] instead. You should then _continue to roleplay appropriately for the remainder of that scene_, or for as long as you feel comfortable, in whatever way you feel is appropriate to your interpretation of that condition.

> #nb
> Once a condition has been used in this way, put a light ╳ mark through the circle symbol next to it on your [character sheet](#charsheet) (eg. ❍ → $\xcancel{❍}$); and at the end of the session you can erase all the ╳s, so you're fresh for next time.

### Taking and Removing Conditions

You may receive a random condition from some of your [[walks of life]], for free; and any others must be bought, using 'caps', during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]]. Beyond that, you can get scars during play from being wounded ([[#Wounds and Scars|see below]]).

**You may only have six conditions at most though, at any one time, and so should you gain another _while at six_ then decide on which one is more important.**

The conditions found in the [[Condition Suggestions]] have definitions and suggestions for their use, but these are not hard and fast rules, and you can make up new conditions on the fly quite easily, with [[Peers|Peer approval]].

Ultimately, a condition is just a name or a phrase. The interpretation of its meaning and the application of its mechanics are left to you, the owner; _the one who has to live with it._

#### Catharsis

_Once per condition_, **when you tell a tale to someone about how you got a particular scar and escaped with your life, or take the opportunity to vent about your condition, or otherwise open up about your traumatic experiences with someone you trust in an intimate moment**, put a tick mark (ie. ✓) next to the name of that condition, and tell your [[Peers]], indicating that you are ready to move on from it.

From then onward, at any time, **you can regain your [[Ego]]** by _spending that tick_ and either changing the condition to become a [[Circumstances|circumstance]], or removing it entirely from your character sheet.

#imp Catharsis does not necessarily 'cure' you of a given condition. More likely, it's a recognition that you've learned to cope with it, and can metaphorically _move on to greener pastures_. The baggage stays with you, but you're stronger for it.

###### Why are conditions like this?

It is fairly commonly knowledge these days that the same medical condition can affect different people in many different ways, but less well-known is that a single condition can affect the same person in many different ways _over time_. Handicaps are neither uniform nor universal.

There is really no single 'good' way to represent such things in a roleplaying game, but having a singular penalty that's _always applied_ certainly seems like a 'bad' way. They are simply too complex, and too personal, to make generalized mechanics out of.

The lows of a character's journey can be just as important in a story as their highs. By using a more hands-off approach — _giving the players the power to apply their own penalties as they see fit_ and _rewarding them for it when they do_ — not only makes the consequences sting a little less, it makes sure that the overcoming of personal adversity can be incorporated into the game in a way that can be empowering in it's own right too.

> ##### Limits on using conditions:
> 
> -   Each condition can only earn you [[Lots]] or [[Ego]] once per session.
> -   You cannot stack multiple condition penalties on the same roll.
> -   Once used, you should try to roleplay through the condition appropriately for at least the rest of the scene.
> -   You may only have six 'active' conditions at any one time (not including wounds).
> -   The catharsis mechanic can effectively be used to 'bank' Ego, but these are _single use_ and unique events, and their narrative weight should be emphasized over their benefit to the game system.
> 
> These are _all strictly 'meta-game' concessions_, to prevent abuse of the [[Kismet|kismet system]]. This is not to suggest that a person can't have more than six things adversely affecting them at any one time — and indeed that's what the [[Stress|stresses]] are for as well — but rather that we should focus on the most important aspects of those conditions, _when they matter_.

#que If you don't want to be adversely affected by a condition, and aren't interested in the catharsis mechanic, but representing it is still important to you, then write it in as a [[Circumstances|character circumstance]] instead.

###### Suffering and Trauma in Roleplaying Games

Roleplaying games can be a _tremendously powerful tool_ for exploring deeply personal topics, for going on journeys of self-discovery, and for generally improving your mental well-being. The psychotherapeutic effects are still being discovered, and I'm not qualified to write about them. But it's important to emphasize that _your friends are not your psychiatrists_, and you should think of them as such.

This entire article deals with topics that may be sensitive to some readers. In fact, some players may not wish to deal with these aspects in their game at all. Therefore, _conditions are a completely ignorable mechanic_. **You don't have to take any conditions that you don't want.**

As always, it's important to go over your [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] with your group before you begin play, and to make sure that no one is playing with a condition that may make others feel uneasy, or that no one receives a wound or a scar that makes them genuinely unhappy or frightened, and that no other topics come up which could fracture your friendship over the game.
