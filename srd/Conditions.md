# Conditions

Conditions are features that represent some aspect of your self that you're still working through, or learning how to deal with. They may be physical, mental, social, or even spiritual or magical in nature.

> ### Eg.
>
> They may be the remnants of old wounds; life-long disabilities or freshly discovered ones; compulsive behaviors or addictions; recurring nightmares; strange personality traits or idiosyncrasies; or even some _seemingly trivial_ things like allergies or phobias.

They are not inherently 'good' or 'bad', they're just part of who you are, and sometimes they can get in the way of your character's life at inopportune moments, handicapping them (though, you decide when those moments occur).

### Applying Conditions

Aside from helping you to roleplay, and perhaps encouraging you to try and represent something outside of your normal comfort zone, conditions can be used to make a trade-off when you come to roll dice:

**When you feel a condition should handicap you for a roll, you will suffer an immediate -1 die penalty but you'll also regain [[Ego]]** (or if someone is rolling against you, they gain a +1 bonus die).

**Each condition can only be used this way _once per session_**, so put a checkmark ✓ in the circle next to their name on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] when you do.

❗ Any of your [[Peers]] may _suggest_ that that particular condition should be applied, _but the choice to apply it is ultimately yours alone_.

Occasionally, the use of a condition must be justified to your [[Peers]] if it's not clear to them why it should affect you in this case. This is similar to [[KISSing#Majority Rules|justifying a KISS]].

#### Accepting Your Fate

If you decide that there's _no way you can succeed the roll because of a condition_, or don't even want to attempt a roll for story reasons — while roleplaying appropriately — then **you can 'accept your fate' and automatically fail the roll**.

When you do this, you will **regain [[Ego]] and also refresh the use of a [[Specialties|specialty]] before the end of the session**.

❗ The decision to accept your fate must be made during the discussion and set-up phase of a roll, before rolling dice, and _preferably before even discussing [[Difficulties and Consequences#Setting Difficulties|difficulty]]_.

#### Catharsis

_Once per condition_, **when you allow yourself to be vulnerable in a way that relates to one of your conditions, _cross it out on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]]_** — _indicating that you're ready to move on from it._

**Then at any time afterwards, you can regain your [[Ego]] by _erasing the condition from your character sheet entirely!_**

_Alternatively:_ If you want to keep some remnant of it, or not forget that you had it, then you can list the spent condition as a [[Circumstances|circumstance]] instead.

> ### Eg.
>
> - You tell the tale to someone about how you got a particular scar and escaped with your life.
> - You take an opportunity to vent about hard it can be to live with your condition.
> - You realize that you've been behaving in a toxic way, find someone to apologize to who's been affected by that behavior, and are forgiven.
> - You open up about your traumatic experiences with someone you trust in an intimate moment.
> - You generally just feel healed and rejuvenated, or validated, and ready to find your new self.

❓ Catharsis does not necessarily 'cure' you of a given condition — more likely, it's a recognition that you've learned to cope with it and you can _move on_ from it — the baggage stays with you, but you're stronger for it.

❗ The catharsis mechanic can effectively be used to 'bank' Ego, but these are _single use_ and unique events, and their narrative weight should be emphasized over their benefit to the game system.

###### Why are conditions like this?

It is fairly commonly knowledge these days that the same medical condition can affect different people in different ways, but less well-known is that the same condition can affect the same person in different ways _over time_. **Handicaps are neither uniform nor universal**. Additionally, not all conditions are medical in nature, some just relate to your personality or backstory.

The lows of a character's journey can be just as important in a story as their highs, though. By using a more hands-off approach — _giving the players the power to apply their own penalties as they see fit_ and _rewarding them for it when they do_ — not only makes the consequences sting a little less, it makes sure that the overcoming of personal adversity can be incorporated into the game in a way that can be empowering in it's own right too.

As always, it's important to go over your [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] with your group before you begin play, and to make sure that no one is playing with a condition that may make others feel uneasy, or that no one receives a wound or a scar that makes them genuinely unhappy or frightened, and that no other topics come up which could fracture your friendship over the game.

### Earning New Conditions

All characters start with a few conditions from the [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] process, for free. Additional conditions must be bought using [[Character Assembly Points Menu#Condition Costs|caps]]. **Though, you don't have to take any conditions that you don't want.**

Beyond that, you can **get scars during play from [[#Wounds and Scars|being wounded]]**, and you can also **earn new conditions during a [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|feature vote]]**.

#### Returning Conditions

Some conditions can _come back_, even after experiencing [[#Catharsis]] with them, but this is rare, should be agreed upon by [[Peers|your Peers]], and _can only occur once per [[Campaign Arcs|arc]]_.

#### Making New Conditions

The conditions found in the [[D666 Conditions]] list are literally just words or short phrases, with no preset definition or suggested uses, so new conditions can be created on the fly quite easily, with approval from [[Peers|your Peers]].

**Ultimately, the interpretation of a condition's meaning and the application of its mechanics are left to you, the owner** — _the one who has to live with it._
