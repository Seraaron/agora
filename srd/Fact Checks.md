### Fact Checks

This is a way to let you **remember things your character should already know** in relation to [[Specialties|specialty]], *using a [[Resolve]] check*; or to **discover new information about the topic**, *using a [[Wits]] check*. We call this process 'establishing a fact'.

**There's two ways you can interpret these rolls, either you roll first and let the result determine what kind of information you learn, or you can propose your idea first and then roll to see if it's true.** This works similar to a normal [[Checks|Check]], except the quality or validity of the information you want to learn or establish (respectively) can depend on the number of successes you roll:

| Successes | Validity                                               |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|     0     | Hearsay and rumors, or *just plain old lies*       |
|     1     | Common knowledge                                       |
|     2     | Obscure knowledge                                      |
|     3+    | Secrets and mysteries,  or *plot-convenient knowledge* |

#que Establishing facts requires input and cooperation from your [[Peers]], but enables you to do some light collaborative [[Worldbuilding|worldbuilding]] at the table.

In some instances, your [[Facilitator]] may veto these ideas and disallow the Check, but only if they would contradict other pre-planned bits of information. However, in those cases, **the FC can offer some of their pre-written information to you on a successful Fact check instead**.

> If the Check fails then the FC may simply say that you don't remember clearly, or they may *subvert the fact*, taking your idea and flipping it on its head somehow, or they may say your character thinks that it's one way when really it's another way â€” and then let the dramatic irony hang.

#imp When new facts are esablished or discovered, it's a good idea to *write them down* and [[Taking notes|take notes]].
