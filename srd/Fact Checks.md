#### Fact Checks

You will sometimes reach points in the game **when you need to know what your character knows**, and your [[Facilitator|FC]] might not be sure about how much information to give you (or how much truth there is to what your character _thinks_ they know). This is when we use a special kind of [[Checks|Check]].

Fact checks are not only a useful way of  **remember things your character should already know**, _using a [[Resolve]] check_, they can also be used to **discover new information about a relevant topic**, _using a [[Wits]] check_. We call either process 'establishing a fact'.

❗ The facts that you can establish should always be related to one of your [[Habits]], [[Circumstances|circumstances]], or [[Specialties|specialties]].

**There's two ways you can interpret these rolls, either you roll first and let the result determine what kind of information you learn, or you can propose your idea first and then roll to see if it's true.** This works similar to a normal [[Checks|Check]], except the quality or validity of the information you want to learn or establish (respectively) can depend on the number of successes you roll:

| Successes | Validity                                               |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|     0     | Hearsay and rumors, or _just plain old lies_           |
|     1     | Common knowledge (partial failure)                     |
|     2     | Obscure knowledge (regular success)                    |
|     3+    | Secrets and mysteries,  or _plot-convenient knowledge_ |

❓ Establishing facts requires input and cooperation from your [[Peers]], but enables you to do some light collaborative [[Worldbuilding|worldbuilding]] at the table.

In some instances, your [[Facilitator]] may veto these ideas and disallow the Check, but only if they would contradict other pre-planned bits of information. However, in those cases, **the FC can offer some of their pre-written information to you on a successful Fact check instead**.

> ### Nb.

> If the Check fails then the FC may simply say that you don't remember clearly, or they may _subvert the fact_, taking your idea and flipping it on its head somehow, or they may say your character thinks that it's one way when really it's another way — and then _let the dramatic irony hang_.

❗ When new facts are esablished or discovered, it's a good idea to _write them down_ and [[Taking notes|take notes]].
