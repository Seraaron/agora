## Checks

**Checks are more straightforward than [[Tasks]].** They are mostly _a measure of your raw talent and luck_, and can only be used to achieve one thing at a time by using simple verbs (see the [[Abilities|ability lists]] for example verbs).

Once your [[Agenda|agenda]] is clear, **pick up three dice**, _or fewer if the [[Abilities|ability]] or [[Capabilities|capability]] you're using for the Check is currently [[Stress|stressed]]_. Use an extra die if you're receiving [[Helping|help]], rolled separately.

#imp There is no other way to gain bonus dice on a Check. **Assets and gear cannot be used.**

### Making a Check

Once the [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|consequences]] of failure are clear and the difficulty is set, then **roll the dice and _count successes_ for each face that lands on a number _equal to or greater than_ your [[Rank|rank]]** for the chosen ability. Then compare the results of your roll to the difficulty:

1.  **Easy:** Needs _one_ or more success to pass.
2.  **Normal:** Needs at least _two_ successes to pass.
3.  **Hard:** Needs _three_ successes to pass.

A 'pass' means _you get your intent_, and so you or the FC can describe what happens next.

Failing to pass — sometimes called a 'miss' — still means that you or the FC will describe what happens next; but instead of getting what you want, you instead _suffer the consequences_ and the game may divert down a new path and force you to reevaluate your current priorities.

> #nb
> This is all part of the fun of roleplaying. The consequences of failing a Check are usually not as severe as for failing [[Tasks]], and often a Check isn't said to [[Let the dice rest|'rest']] in the same way a Task might; meaning you may be able to try again if the opportunity presents itself.

#que Checks have _binary_ 'pass' or 'fail' conditions to keep them fast-paced and exciting. If you want a more nuanced outcome then use a [[Tasks|Task]] instead.

#### Fewer dice than the difficulty?

If the Check difficulty is _hard_, say, and you only have two dice to roll due to [[Stress|being stressed]], then you either _have to get [[Helping|help]]_ to even have a chance at passing, or else you _must use a specialty or Ego_ ([[#Auto-passing Checks|see below]]).

#### Auto-passing Checks

If you have rolled the dice and so-far failed to pass, then _as a last resort_ you may use a relevant [[Specialties|specialty]] — describing how it aids you, and crossing it off for the session, if your [[Peers]] agree — to automatically pass the Check.

Alternatively, if you have no relevant specialty, then you may use your [[Ego]] to automatically pass instead. _Else, you must accept your failure and move on._

#imp Unlike Tasks, you cannot [[KISSing|KISS]] dice on Checks, and there is no avenue for spending Lots on Checks either.

### Group Checks

If there is a roll that all the [[Player Characters]] must complete to progress as a group, then **everyone should make the same Check separately**, _all using their own ability ranks_ to count successes, and all using the same difficulty, rather than [[Helping|helping]] one another.

-   If **all but one of the group participants pass**, _then the whole group passes_.
-   If **more than one participant fails** then either _the whole group fails together_, and everyone is compromised, or those individuals fail while the rest pull through; depending on the context of the roll.

Specialties or Ego can be used by anyone to pull themselves up to a pass ([[#Auto-passing Checks|see above]]), but those who already succeeded _can also use their specialties or Ego to pull up anyone else who failed_, if they want to; promoting a sense of team work.

### Versus Checks

When two or more characters want to compete to do the same thing — such as race to a goal, or say something important before the other can interrupt, or solve a problem the quickest — where there would be _a clear winner at the end of the action;_ then all those characters should each **perform a Check separately**, _using the same ability and difficulty_, and **the one who passes wins**.

_If there's a tie_ (or if no one passes the Check) then you either reach the goal simultaneously or the competition continues using a different [[Abilities|ability]] until a clear winner is found (or none of you get what you wanted), whichever makes more sense.

> #eg
> A chase might start off as a [[Swiftness]] check; but then progress to a [[Finesse]] check if you run into a busy market and start throwing stalls over and dodging between carts; and could then go to an [[Endurance]] check if you're still neck and neck.

To resolve more complex competing agendas, use an [[Opposed Tasks|opposed Task roll]], or a more [[advanced conflict subsystem]].
