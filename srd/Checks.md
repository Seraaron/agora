## Checks

**Checks are more straightforward than [[Tasks]].** They are mostly *a measure of your raw talent and luck*, and can only be **used to achieve one thing at a time using simple verbs** (see the [[Abilities|ability lists]] for some example verbs).

Make sure you always discuss what you're trying to achieve with your [[Peers]] before rolling, so that the [[Facilitator]] can set the [[Difficulties and Consequences|set the consequences]] appropriately. This is called your [[Agenda|agenda]], and if it's not clear before the dice hit the table then the roll is void.

### Making a Check

**Pick up three dice**, *then remove dice equal to any [[Stress]] in the ability you'll be rolling with*. The minimum pool size for a Check is 1 die. Then you may choose ***one* [[Assets and Gear|asset or peice of gear]]** and add it's dice to your pool. You may also receive [[Helping|help]] from an ally, *but this does not grant bonus dice* (see [[#KISSing Checks|below]]).

**Roll all your dice and *count successes* for each face that lands on a number *equal to or greater than* your [[Rank|rank]]** for the chosen [[Abilities|ability]] or [[Capabilities|capability]].

Compare your successes to the following chart to determine the result:

| Successes | *Result*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|   **0**   | **Tough failure:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|   (~45%)  | *Your action doesn't quite work out as intended. Something interrupts you, your intentions are twisted against you, or new information is revealed that changes the situation.

|   **2**   | **Regular pass:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|   (~20%)  | *Your agenda is fulfilled. You get what you wanted, and generally succeed without any major issues. You may describe your success, or speak in character, if the action is physical or social.

|   **3+**  | **Pass with flying colors:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   (~5%)   | *Your objective is completed with ease and aplomb or with time to spare. Your FC may give you additional information they would have otherwise kept secret. In some cases you may gain a new item or remove a point of stress. In other cases you just get to show off.*                                               |

#que The percentages listed above are your approximate chances of rolling that many successes with 3 rank 5 dice. (You can find more numbers like these in the [[Dice Probabilities and Statistics]] article).

#### KISSing Checks

After the dice have been rolled, if you've not succeeded to your level of satisfaction then **you may [[KISSing|KISS]] some of the failed dice to try and seize back victory**. This is a procedure that lets you make use your [[KISSing#Kismet|Kismet]], [[KISSing#Insights|Insights]], [[KISSing#Stunts|Stunts]], or [[KISSing#Specialties|Specialties]] to re-roll some dice, or you can use [[Ego]] to double the successes from any 6s you rolled.

**If you've received [[Helping|help]], then your ally can KISS for you as well**.

#imp [[Lots]] spent on Checks do not convert to *[[Earning Experience|exp]]*, however.

###### Embracing Failure

Failure makes up the majority of the outcomes in the table above, but the consequences of failing a Check are usually not as severe as for failing [[Tasks]]. You may also be able to try the Check again at a later date if the opportunity presents itself, but the story should always be moving forwards.

However, when a roll is made and the results are not in your favor, the consequences *can be discussed* with your [[Peers]] to ensure that everyone is happy with the compromise. This helps to avoid accidental favoritism or arbitrary punishment, and generally makes the process more collaborative.

#### Taking your Time

**If you're in a situation where time is not pressing, then a Check is usually not necessary.** You can simply say that you want to "take your time" with the Check, and it will be *automatically passed* (as though you had rolled 2 successes). However, the **amount of time that will pass is up to your Peers**.

This should be a realistically long time for the agenda. 20 minutes is a good average for most things, but it really depends on the action and intent. Sometimes it can take up to an hour, or even a whole day!

**Your Facilitator may veto a slow Check** and rule that your intent can't be achieved carefully, if they feel that time *is* of the essence. In these instances you *must roll* or else not perform the action at all.

![[Stressful Rolls]]

### Group Checks

If there is a roll that all the [[Player Characters]] must complete to progress as a group, then **everyone should make the same Check separately**, *each using their own ability ranks* to count successes, and all using the same difficulty.

**To pass as a group, you must roll a total number of successes equal to the number of participants**.

-   Rolling any fewer successes than this means that you *collectively fail with a twist:* Either someone is straggling behind and gets caught at the last instant, or someone misunderstands the plan and it all goes awry.
-   Getting twice as many successes as the goal means you *collectively pass with flying colors:* Everyone gets through with time to spare, you can each spend a moment showing off, or the plan works out better than expected.

[[KISSing|KISSes]] can be used as per usual, but those whose dice have already all landed as successes *can also use their KISSes to pull up anyone else who failed*, as though everyone is [[Helping|helping]] one another; promoting a sense of team work.

#que If the Group check is also '[[Stressful Rolls|stressful]]' then only the participants who failed their roll receive the stress, not the whole group.

### Versus Checks

When two or more characters want to compete to do the same thing, with equal or opposite objectives — such as race to a goal, or say something important before the other can interrupt, or solve a problem the quickest — where there would be *a clear winner at the end of the action;* then all those characters should each **perform a Check separately**, *using the same ability and difficulty*, and **the one with the most successes wins**.

*If there's a tie* then you either reach the goal simultaneously or the competition continues using a different [[Abilities|ability]] until a clear winner is found, whichever makes more sense.

> #eg
> A chase might start off as a [[Swiftness]] check; but then progress to a [[Finesse]] check if you run into a busy market and start throwing stalls over and dodging between carts; and could then go to an [[Endurance]] check if you're still neck and neck.

Use an [[Opposed Tasks|Opposed task]] roll to resolve more complex competing agendas, or a [[Conflict Systems|conflict system]] for a detailed breakdown of the moment-to-moment action.
