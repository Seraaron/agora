## Checks

**Checks are more straightforward than [[Tasks]].** They are mostly _a measure of your raw talent and luck_, and can only be **used to achieve one thing at a time using simple verbs** (see the [[Abilities|ability lists]] for some example verbs).

Make sure you always discuss what you're trying to achieve with your [[Peers]] before rolling, so that the [[Facilitator]] can set the [[Difficulties and Consequences|set the consequences]] appropriately. This is called your [[Agenda|agenda]], and if it's not clear before the dice hit the table then the roll is void.

### Making a Check

**Pick up three dice**, _then remove dice equal to any [[Stress]] in the ability you'll be rolling with_. The minimum pool size for a Check is one die.

**Roll all your dice and _count successes_ for each face that lands on a number _equal to or greater than_ your [[Rank|rank]]** for the chosen [[Abilities|ability]] or [[Capabilities|capability]].

Compare your successes to the following chart to determine the result:

| Successes | _Result_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|   **0**   | **Tough Failure:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   (~30%)  | _You don't get what you wanted and time progresses. The consequences of your actions still play out, but nothing of value is gained — except the knowledge that you should probably try a different approach — and some opportunities or resources may be lost._                                                      |
|   **1**   | **Partial Pass / Fail with a Twist:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   (~45%)  | _Your action doesn't quite work out as intended. Something interrupts you, your intentions are bent against you, or new information is revealed that changes the situation. Your agenda is unfulfilled and your objective is left incomplete, but you've at least made progress and gained something in the process._ |
|   **2**   | **Regular Pass:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|   (~20%)  | _Your agenda is fulfilled. You get what you wanted, and generally succeed without any major issues. You may describe your success, or speak in character, if the action is physical or social. If it was information you sought, then your FC should tell you what you want to know._                                 |
|   **3+**  | **Pass with Flying Colors:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   (~5%)   | _Your objective is completed with ease and aplomb or with time to spare. Your FC may give you additional information they would have otherwise kept secret. In some cases you may gain a new item or remove a point of stress. In other cases you just get to show off._                                              |

❓ The percentages listed above are your approximate chances of rolling that many successes with three rank 5 dice, _without [[KISSing]]_. (You can find more numbers like these in the [[Dice Probabilities and Statistics*]] article).

#### Difficulty?

There is no inherent [[Difficulties and Consequences|difficulty]] for Checks, other than your own [[Stress|stress]] making the roll harder. Therefore, **Checks mostly reflect a personal struggle**. If you want there to be more influence from external sources of difficulty, then use a [[Tasks|Task]] instead.

#### KISSing Checks

After the dice have been rolled, if you've not succeeded to your level of satisfaction then **you may [[KISSing|KISS]] some of the failed dice to try and seize back victory**. This is a procedure that lets you make use your [[KISSing#Kismet|Kismet]], [[KISSing#Insights|Insights]], [[KISSing#Stunts|Stunts]], or [[KISSing#Specialties|Specialties]] to re-roll some dice, or you can use [[Ego]] to double the successes from any 6s you rolled.

**You may also receive [[Helping|help]] to get an ally can KISS some dice for you as well**.

###### Embracing Failure

Failure makes up the majority of the outcomes in the table above, but the consequences of failing a Check are usually not as severe as for failing [[Tasks]]. You may also be able to try the Check again at a later date if the opportunity presents itself, but the story should always be moving forwards.

However, when a roll is made and the results are not in your favor, _the consequences can be discussed_ with your [[Peers]] to ensure that everyone is happy with the compromise. This helps to avoid accidental favoritism or arbitrary punishment, and generally makes the process more collaborative.

#### Slow Checks (Taking your Time)

**If you're in a situation where time is not pressing, then a Check is usually not necessary.** You can simply say that you want to "take your time" with the Check, and it will be _automatically passed_ (as though you had rolled 2 successes). However, the **amount of time that will pass depends on your [[Rank|rank]]:**

| Rank | Slow Check Duration |
| :--: | :------------------ |
|   6  | ~120-180 minutes    |
|   5  | ~60-90 minutes      |
|   4  | ~30-45 minutes      |
|   3  | ~20-30 minutes      |
|   2  | ~10-15 minutes      |
|   1  | ~5-10 minutes       |

**Your Facilitator may veto a Slow Check** and rule that your intent can't be achieved carefully, if they feel that time _is_ of the essence. **In these instances you _must roll_ or else not perform the action at all.**

❗ If you have two points of [[Stress|stress]] in the ability then you cannot make a Slow Check, you must make an active roll instead.

![[Stressful Rolls]]

### Group Checks

If there is a roll that all the [[Player Characters]] must complete to progress as a group, then **everyone should make the same Check separately**, _each using their own ability ranks_ to count successes, and all using the same difficulty.

**To pass as a group, you must roll a total number of successes equal to twice the number of participants**. This is your goal:

- **Rolling any fewer successes than the goal** means that you _collectively fail with a twist:_ Either someone is straggling behind and gets caught at the last instant, or someone misunderstands the plan and it all goes awry.
- **Exceeding the goal by the number of participants** means you _collectively pass with flying colors:_ Everyone gets through with time to spare, you can each spend a moment showing off, or the plan works out better than expected.

[[KISSing|KISSes]] can be used as per usual, but those whose dice have already all landed as successes _can also use their KISSes to pull up anyone else who failed_, **as though everyone is [[Helping|helping]] one another** — promoting a sense of team work.

❓ If the Group check is also '[[Stressful Rolls|stressful]]' then only the participants who failed their individual portion of the roll will receive stress, not the whole group.
