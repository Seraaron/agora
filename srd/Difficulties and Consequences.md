# Difficulty & Consequences

Roleplaying games are ultimately 'mechanical sandboxes'. [[Facilitator|Facilitators]] take on the difficult role of providing both a space for the [[Player Characters]] to inhabit as real (imagined) people, and also the opportunity for them to run amok and [[Agenda|impose their ideals]] onto that space. _Both the character and the world should be changed by the interaction._ **In a nutshell, this is what we call 'consequences'**.

By contrast, **the difficulty represents how likely those characters are to succeed at their objectives, given their actions**.

The two concepts are usually proportional to one another. That is:

-   A very easy thing to do usually has very minor consequences.
-   A standard action has standard consequences.
-   A very hard thing to do should have very major consequences.

## Stating Consequences

Regardless of the difficulty, _the consequences of an action should never be unexpected to the player_, though they may be unforeseen to their character. That is, the FC should make an effort to clearly signal what an outcome is likely to be before it even comes up in conversation — either via their roleplaying and descriptions beforehand, or by directly saying as much out-of-game.

**To take this ethic a step futher:** The FC should always clearly state what the immediate consequences of an action will be (if they've not already been implied), or else answer a player directly if they ask about the consequences. A player should always be allowed to back down from a roll or change their agenda once they understand what those consequences are.

###### No Fishing Allowed

There's no 'game' to this part of the discussion! It's not about being coy with the consequences, or tricking the player into taking an action that they'll regret later. _It's about being upfront and honest about what you think is most likely to happen if they try to do a certain thing._ Conversely, though, a player shouldn't be asking about every available option just to see which has the lightest consequences, else we'll never make progress.

We call both of these interactions "fishing", and they're strictly _not allowed_. [[Peers]] should step in if they feel that either the FC or the currently acting player is fishing while the actions or agenda are being discussed.

### How to describe consequences?

We've been quite abstractly explaining them so far, so let's try a more direct approach: **Consequences are a _short description_ of the events that will occur as a direct result of a PCs actions and objectives, as they pertain to a roll.** You should give you a rough — single-sentence — guide to the player about what  will happen (or might happen) in each case as a result of that roll:

-   If you succeed at the roll (or if no roll is necessary), then you get what you want and your agenda is made manifest. Then the world responds.
-   If you fail the roll, then you don't get what you want and some of your agency is removed as the world responds.

In either case, regardless of success or failure, _the world will respond to your actions_. This is where a lot of the fun of roleplaying comes from.

### Lasting Consequences

An action (no matter how simple or challenging) can sometimes have _indirect_ or _rippling consequences_ that don't rear their heads until a much later date, or which only become apparent after another condition is fulfilled. It's okay if these are not discussed, or even foreseen at the time of the action that caused them; but once _someone_ realizes that this is a possibility (usually the FC), they should begin to hint and signal that the ripples are still there, even tangentially.

These are the best kind of consequences, as they produce emergent behaviors and require good preparation or swift reactivity to deal with appropriately.

## Setting Difficulties

One of the [[Facilitator|Facilitator's]] roles is to '**play the world**'. The characters in that world will usually have a more intuitive understanding of how to interact with it than their players will. Therefore, the FC is there to provide the feedback for the players that their imagination cannot, so that they can make _informed decisions_.

**Setting the difficulty for a roll is a part of this feedback.**

The way you present that difficulty depends on the [[Checks vs. Tasks|type of roll]]:

-   [[Checks]] use _three simple difficulty options_ — easy, normal, and hard — which keeps them quick and easy to run through.
-   [[Tasks]] use _difficulty factors_, which can take a bit longer to go through in deciding which are the most appropriate, as they can come from multiple sources.

### Choosing Difficulty for Checks

**The difficulty of a Check should be primarily _based on a gut feeling_.** If the desired action seems like it would be fairly routine, for this character, then go with an 'easy' Check. If it seems difficult, but not _too difficult_, then use a 'normal' Check. And if you think it'd be pretty challenging, then say it's 'hard'.

As an [[Facilitator|FC]], you'll build up a better '[[#Getting a 'Sense of Difficulty'|sense of difficulty]]' over time, and will learn to more-quickly assign Check difficulties to more you play. But if you're ever unsure, then just default to saying it's a normal Check until you feel more confident.

_However, here's a useful trick that you can also employ:_ Since Checks use solely ability ranks and simple verbs, and everyone in the world shares the same abilities, you can try to imagine yourself attempting the same action that the player is describing, and then think about how hard it might be for you to do the same thing — drawing on your real world experiences.

### Applying Factors for Tasks

If Checks use an 'absolute' scale of difficulties, then Tasks can be considered to use a 'relative' scale. This is represented using a slew of equally weighted factors, rather than a fixed target number (though some Tasks — especially in certain subsystems, like [[Martial Combat|combat]] — do use set targets).

There are three main sources of factors for a Task: **The number of objectives**, any **job-specific factors**, and **generic factors**.

-   **The number of objectives** is decided by the player during the [[Tasks#1 Set-up|set-up phase]] of the Task discussion. Each objective, including the main objective, counts as a factor, up to a maximum total of 4.
-   **Job-specific factors** are listed for each job in the [[Jobs List|job list]], and almost always apply whenever they're relevant. (There are only a few such factors per job, but they should be fairly obvious without the need to look them up).
-   **Generic factors** may be suggested by any [[Peers|Peer]], from [[Generic Difficulty Factor Examples List|the example list]] below or by making something up, but the FC ultimately decides which ones to choose and apply — based on the factor's relevancy to the action, and any other information they may be privy to.

#### Choosing Factors

Each chosen factor should feel like it's carrying a little bit more narrative weight than the last, because the dice mechanics have a bell-shaped probability curve and the addition of a single extra factor can make a Task substantially less likely to succeed. Therefore, it's important to keep two things in mind when choosing factors:

-   **Try to choose the most important and most relevant factors first**, in this order: objectives first, then job factors, then generic factors.
-   **Try not to 'double-dip' or 'triple-dip'** by applying a factor from multiple sources for effectively the same reason.

As with Checks, you will get a better '[[#Getting a 'Sense of Difficulty'|sense of difficulty]]' over time, but in this case there's no easy trick to follow because you can't be expected to know how every job works at all times. There will need to be some frequent referencing when you first start playing, but hopefully that will happen less often over time (especially if your [[Peers]] help you out — and then you all learn together too).

### Getting a 'Sense of Difficulty'

It may be useful to consider how difficult a given roll may be based on how many factors it has, using a combination of _heuristics and statistics_.

First lets think about what it should _feel like_ to have to overcome a certain number of factors:

1.  **Simple** — you're _almost guaranteed_ to get what you want (equivalent to an 'easy' check with 3 dice)
2.  **Fair** — about a fifty-fifty shot even for adepts (equivalent to a 'normal' check with 3 dice)
3.  **Tough** — the upper limit of expected success for most people's raw job level (equivalent to a 'hard' check with 3 dice)
4.  **Challenging** — may need to KISS a die or two or get lucky with 6s and spend Ego
5.  **Ambitious** — would probably need help, assets, or other bonus dice to make up the difference
6.  **Absurd** — generally requires all of the bonus dice you can find _and_ some lucky KISSes

Next, consider the following table, which describes exactly how likely you are to succeed at a roll with 1-6 factors, using 1-6 **rank 5** dice (without KISSing):

| Success Chance |   1D  |   2D  |   3D  |   4D  |   5D  |   6D  |
| -------------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|       1 Factor | 33.3% | 55.6% | 70.4% | 80.2% | 86.8% | 91.2% |
|      2 Factors |   —   | 11.1% | 25.9% | 40.7% | 53.9% | 64.9% |
|      3 Factors |   —   |   —   | 3.70% | 11.1% | 21.0% | 32.0% |
|      4 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   | 1.23% | 4.53% | 10.0% |
|      5 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   | 0.41% | 1.78% |
|      6 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   | 0.14% |

If you find this table useful, you can find more tables and graphs like it in the [[Dice Probabilities and Statistics]] appendix.

#que With all of this in mind, you can _almost_ consider a Check to be a simplified Task that uses a level 3 ability with a single objective and no (easy), one (normal), or two (hard) difficulty factors.
