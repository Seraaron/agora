# Difficulty & Consequences

Roleplaying games are ultimately 'mechanical sandboxes'. [[Facilitator|Facilitators]] take on the difficult role of providing both a space for the [[Player Characters]] to inhabit as real (imagined) people, and also the opportunity for them to run amok and [[Agenda|impose their ideals]] onto that space. _Both the character and the world should be changed by the interaction._ **In a nutshell, this is what we call 'consequences'**.

By contrast, **the 'difficulty' represents how likely those characters are to succeed at their objectives, given their actions**.

The two concepts are usually proportional to one another. _That is:_

- A very easy thing to do usually has very minor consequences.
- A standard action has standard consequences.
- A very hard thing to do should have very major consequences.

Though sometimes, _even a minor act can change the world forever_.

## Stating Consequences

Regardless of the difficulty, **the consequences of an action should never be unexpected to the player** _though they may be unforeseen to their character_. The [[Facilitator|FC]] should make an effort to clearly signal what an outcome is likely to be before it even comes up in conversation — either via their roleplaying and descriptions beforehand, or by directly saying as much out-of-game.

**To take this ethic a step futher:** The FC should always clearly state what the immediate consequences of an action will be (if they've not already been implied), or else answer a player directly if they ask about the consequences.

❗ A player should always be allowed to back down from a roll or change their agenda once they understand what those consequences are.

###### No Fishing Allowed

There's no 'game' to this part of the discussion! It's not about being coy with the consequences, or tricking the player into taking an action that they'll regret later. _It's about being upfront and honest about what you think is most likely to happen if they try to do a certain thing._ Conversely, a player shouldn't be asking about every available option just to see which has the lightest consequences, else we'll never make progress.

We call both of these interactions "fishing", and they're strictly _not allowed_. [[Peers]] should step in if they feel that either the FC or the currently acting player is fishing while the actions or agenda are being discussed.

### Describing Consequences

We've been quite abstractly explaining them so far, so let's try a more direct approach: **Consequences are a _short description_ of the events that will occur as a direct result of a PCs actions and objectives, as they pertain to a roll.** You should give you a rough — single-sentence — guide to the player about what  will happen (or might happen) in each case as a result of that roll:

- If you succeed at the roll (or if no roll is necessary), then you get what you want and your agenda is made manifest. Then the world responds.
- If you fail the roll, then you don't get what you want and some of your agency is removed as the world responds.

**In either case, regardless of success or failure, _the world will respond to your actions_.** This is where a lot of the fun of roleplaying comes from.

### Lasting Consequences

An action (no matter how simple or challenging) can sometimes have _indirect_ or _rippling consequences_ that don't rear their heads until a much later date, or which only become apparent after another condition is fulfilled. It's okay if these are not discussed, or even foreseen at the time of the action that caused them. Still, once _someone_ realizes that this is a possibility (usually the [[Facilitator|FC]]), they should begin to hint and signal that the ripples are still there — even tangentially.

These are the best kind of consequences, in many ways, as they produce emergent behaviors and require good preparation or swift reactivity to deal with appropriately.

## Setting Difficulties

One of the [[Facilitator|Facilitator's]] roles is to '**play the world**'. The characters in that world will usually have a more intuitive understanding of how to interact with it than their players will. Therefore, the FC is there to provide the feedback for the players that their imagination cannot, so that they can make _informed decisions_.

**Setting the difficulty for a roll is a part of this feedback.**

### Difficulty for Checks

**The [[Checks#Difficulty|difficulty]] of a [[Checks|Check]] is purely _character based_.** [[Stress]] is the only thing that makes a Check harder.

> ### Ie.
>
> Because 2 or more successes _always equals a pass_, and 1 or fewer successes _always equals a miss_, the biggest limiting factor is applied by your [[Stress|stress]] level in the ability being rolled. Otherwise, you always roll 3 dice.

This makes Checks very easy to set up and resolve. The hardest part is actually deciding [[Using Checks and Tasks|whether to use a Check or a Task]].

### Difficulty for Tasks

If Checks use an 'absolute' scale of difficulty, then **[[Tasks]] use a 'relative' scale of difficulty**. This is represented using a slew of equally weighted factors, rather than a fixed target number. (Though some Tasks — especially in certain subsystems, like [[Martial Combat|combat]] — do use set targets).

There are three main sources of factors for a Task: **The number of objectives**, any **job-specific factors**, and **[[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]]**.

- **The number of objectives** is decided by the player during the [[Tasks#1 Set-up|set-up phase]] of the Task discussion. Each objective, including the main objective, counts as a factor, up to a maximum total of 4.
- **Job-specific factors** are listed for each job in the [[Jobs List|job list]], and almost always apply whenever they're relevant. (There are only a few such factors per job, but they should be fairly obvious without needing to look them up every time).
- **Generic factors** may be suggested by any [[Peers|Peer]], from [[Generic Difficulty Factors|the example list]] (below) or by making something up, but the [[Facilitator|FC]] ultimately decides which ones to choose and apply — based on the factor's relevancy to the action, and any other information they may be privy to.

### Weighing Factors

**Each chosen factor should feel like it's carrying a little bit more narrative weight than the last**, because *the dice mechanics have a bell-shaped probability curve* and the addition of a single extra factor can make a Task substantially less likely to succeed. Therefore, it's important to keep two things in mind when choosing factors:

- **Try to choose the most important and most relevant factors first**, in this order: Objectives first, then job factors, then generic factors.
- **Try not to 'double-dip' or 'triple-dip'** by applying a factor from multiple sources for effectively the same reason.

There will need to be some frequent referencing when you first start playing, but hopefully that will happen less often over time. Especially if your [[Peers]] help you out — and then you all learn together too — and you will all slowly gain a 'sense of difficulty'.

### Getting a 'Sense of Difficulty'

It may be useful to consider how difficult a given roll may be based on how many factors it has, **using a combination of _heuristics and statistics_**.

First lets think about what it should _feel like_ to have to overcome a certain number of factors:

1. **Simple** — You're _almost guaranteed_ to get what you want.
2. **Fair** — About a fifty-fifty shot, even for adepts.
3. **Tough** — The upper limit of expected success for most people using only their job level.
4. **Challenging** — May need to KISS a die or two or get lucky with 6s and spend Ego.
5. **Ambitious** — Would probably need to use assets, get help, or gain bonus dice from other sources to make up the difference.
6. **Absurd** — Requires a high job level and all of the bonus dice you can find, _and_ some lucky KISSes.

Next, consider the following table, which describes exactly how likely you are to succeed at a roll with 1-6 factors, using one to six **rank 5** dice (without KISSing):

| Success Chance |   1D  |   2D  |   3D  |   4D  |   5D  |   6D  |
| -------------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|       1 Factor | 33.3% | 55.6% | 70.4% | 80.2% | 86.8% | 91.2% |
|      2 Factors |   —   | 11.1% | 25.9% | 40.7% | 53.9% | 64.9% |
|      3 Factors |   —   |   —   | 3.70% | 11.1% | 21.0% | 32.0% |
|      4 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   | 1.23% | 4.53% | 10.0% |
|      5 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   | 0.41% | 1.78% |
|      6 Factors |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   |   —   | 0.14% |

If you find this table useful, you can find more tables and graphs like it in the [[Dice Probabilities and Statistics]] appendix.

❓ With all of this in mind, you can _almost_ consider a Check to be a simplified Task that uses a level 3 ability with two factors.
