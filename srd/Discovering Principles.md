### Discovering Principles

If players are finding the process of thinking of [[Principles|principles]] from scratch exhausting, or simply not suitable for their [[Player Styles|style of play]], then this alternative rule may be more appropriate. This rule can also be used when a player has finished a [[Goals|goal]], for example, but can't think of anything else to replace it with yet.

If you announce that you want to *discover a principle* then it's left intentionally blank until you think of something to fill it with. This is usually inspired by things that have happened in the setting, a new situation your character finds themselves in, or as a direct response to something that happened during play. Sometimes your character will say something in character that they believe in, *or acts in a new and unexpected way*, and a new principle condenses in that same moment.

These moments are called **discoveries**, and when they happen you can say "I've discovered something about my character", or if a [[Peers|Peer]] notices the discovery before you do they can point it out and say "that sounds like it would make a good principle". 

#### Rewarding Discoveries

**When a new principle is discovered through play you immediately earn a [[Lots|Lot]]**.
