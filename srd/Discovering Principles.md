### Discovering Principles

If players are finding the process of thinking of [[Principles|principles]] from scratch exhausting, or simply not suitable for their [[Player Styles|style of play]], then this alternative rule may be more appropriate. This rule can also be used when a player has finished a [[Goals|goal]], for example, but can't think of anything else to replace it with yet.

If you leave a principle intentionally blank, then you can wait until you think of something to fill it with. This is usually inspired by things that have happened in the setting, a new situation your character finds themselves in, or as a direct response to something that happened during play. Sometimes your character will say something in character that they believe in, _or acts in a new and unexpected way_, and a new principle condenses in that same moment.

These moments are called **discoveries**.

#### Rewarding Discoveries

**When a new principle is discovered through play you immediately earn a [[Lots|Lot]]**.
