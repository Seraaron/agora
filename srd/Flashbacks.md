#### _Optional:_ Flashbacks

**It's possible for a [[Habits|Habit]] to allow you briefly cut back to an earlier point in the current scene**, _or even cut to a previously-nonexistent scene._ When something happens, and you realize that one of your Habits would have been useful and that it should've changed the way that you behaved, or if it would change what your current plans are.

**A flashback scene can be used to *jockey for a single +1 bonus die* to your current action** — delivered from the past to the present moment.

❗ The technique of using 'flashbacks' was popularized in **Blades in the Dark**, but *not everyone finds them useful or engaging*, so it's worth discussing with your [[Peers]] whether you want to allow Habits to be used in this way during [[Development Sessions#Session Zero|session zero]].
