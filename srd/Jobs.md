# Jobs

Jobs are what you use to perform [[Tasks]]. The anatomy of a job as it's written on your [character sheet](#charsheet) contains 4 parts:

-   **The *name* of the job:** _Usually the capitalized noun-form of an active verb._
-   **Its associated *ability*:** _The [[Rank|rank]] of which you must usually use to roll with_.
-   **The current job *level*:** _Which is the number of dice you first pick up before adding any bonuses._
-   **An *experience* bar:** _Consisting of six pairs of diamond symbols_ (ie. ◇◇), _used to track level progression for that job._

Jobs in the [[Jobs List]] are also categorized, which should make searching for them easier. These entries start with definitions, then go on to make suggestions for their use, and occasionally offer exceptional use cases with other abilities. Then they give a list of recommended [[Specialties|specialties]], and some offer some potential additional [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|difficulty factors]] that the [[Facilitator|FC]] may want to employ against you when you use that job in a certain way.

###### Jobs not _Jobs_

Despite the name, 'jobs' don't always have to be _literal professions_ or a trade that you ply; they can simply refer to roles or responsibilities that you are capable of undertaking or fulfilling; and _may be closer to sets of related skills_ in that sense. Some jobs are more like _archetypes_ that cover a much broader — but all thematically related — range of skills, such as most of the jobs in the '[[Jobs List#Rogue Jobs|Rogue]]' category.

## Earning Experience

There are _three main ways_ to attain experience points (or 'exp' for short), representing your increasing technical knowledge, confidence, and general savviness, or good fortune:

-   **When you fail a [[Tasks|Task]]** — by not getting enough successes to overcome the number of factors against you. _This represents trying to learn from your mistakes._
-   **When you spend [[Lots]] during downtime or debriefs** — or when you exceed eight Lots total. Lots can be converted into exp for a job of your choice, with a 1:1 ratio. _This represents an investment of fate into your chosen destiny._
-   **When you learn something new** — after making a critical roll, or completing a relevant story moment, or when an [[Non-player Characters|NPC]] teaches you something. The exp is awarded by your [[Facilitator|FC]]. _This literally just represents learning stuff you didn't know before_.

Each time you earn exp, _fill in a single diamond beneath that job's name on your character sheet_ (ie. ◇◇ → ◆◇  or ◆◇ → ◆◆). So there's a little bit of book-keeping to track while playing the game, but it _drastically increases_ the general sense of progression.

The other way to [[Campaign structure#Downtime learning scenes|earn exp is during downtime]], by creating relevant scenes to show what you've been up to. _The longer the time skip, the more exp you can earn_.

### Leveling Up

**When you attain experience points equal to _twice the next level_ in that job**, then clean the filled exp bar and raise the job level by **+1**. At first you will seem to level up quickly, but then it will take longer and longer until you plateau.

#que The exp diamonds are presented in pairs to help you count out the right amount of exp for each level.

| Current level | Exp required to +1 | Bar appearance, when filled |
| :-----------: | :----------------: | :-------------------------: |
|     **0**     |         2*         |      ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **1**     |          4         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **2**     |          6         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **3**     |          8         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **4**     |         10         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇      |
|     **5**     |         12         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆      |
|     **6**     |         12         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆      |

#ast Only one level 0 job can advance to level 1 per [[chapter]] ([[#Learning New Jobs Level 0|see below]]).

###### 6 is the normal maximum job level

To attain supernatural levels _beyond six_ you must re-fill the exp bar to twelve and then receive a supernatural blessing, high-tech augmentation, or otherwise gain a special [[Gambits|gambit]]; all of which require your [[Peers|Peer's approval]].

### Learning New Jobs (Level 0)

When your [[Peers]] decide that you don't have the right job to [[Agenda|fulfil your agenda]] — either because your objectives don't match your actions, or because the jobs you _do_ have don't have the right ability associated with them — _then you must start learning whatever they decide the 'right' job is_.

-   **Add the new job to your character sheet in a blank space under the 'Jobs' heading at level 0.** This means you have no native dice to roll, and _you must roll a [[Tasks#No dice Roll the Die of Fortune|die of fortune]] to perform tasks instead_, unless you can gain some additional bonus dice. The die of fortune is rank 6, but it _explodes_ to represent a sense of beginner's luck.
-   **To advance from level 0 to level 1:** You must fill the exp bar with two points as described above, but then _only one job may be advanced from level 0 to 1 each [[Campaign structure#Chapters|chapter]]_.
    -   Though this doesn't have to be the first job that gets 2 exp each chapter.
-   **You can sit on a job at level 0 for as long as you like**, and only advance it to level 1 when you're ready, but _you can't earn any excess exp for that job in the meantime_.

If you get to the end of a chapter and still haven't advanced a job from level 0 to 1, then choose one that's at 2 exp during the [[Debriefings|debrief]] and level it up then and there; so that you're fresh for the next chapter.
