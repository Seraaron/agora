## Jobs

Jobs are what you use to perform [[Tasks]]. The anatomy of a job as it's written on your [character sheet](#charsheet) contains 4 parts:

- **The _name_ of the job:** _Usually the capitalized noun-form of an active verb._
- **Its associated _ability_:** _The [[Rank|rank]] of which you must usually use to roll with_.
- **The current job _level_:** _Which is the number of dice you first pick up before adding any bonuses._
- **An _experience_ bar:** _Consisting of six pairs of diamond symbols_ (ie. ◇◇), _used to track level progression for that job._

Jobs in the [[Jobs List]] are also categorized, which should make searching for them easier. These entries start with definitions, then go on to make suggestions for their use, and occasionally offer exceptional use cases with other abilities. Then they give a list of recommended [[Specialties|specialties]], and some offer some potential additional [[Difficulties and Consequences|difficulty factors]] that the [[Facilitator|FC]] may want to employ against you when you use that job in a certain way.

###### Jobs not _Jobs_

Despite the name, 'jobs' don't always have to be _literal professions_ or a trade that you ply — they can simply refer to roles or responsibilities that you are capable of undertaking or fulfilling. (They may be closer to _sets of related skills_ in that sense).

Some jobs are more like _archetypes_ that cover a much broader — but all thematically related — range of skills, such jobs also come with tags that help to group them together.

### Levels in Context

Levels are a numerical representation of your general proficiency at performing the complex [[Tasks]] listed in a job's description. Levels are the starting amount of dice you use to perform those tasks. This can often seem quite abstract, so if you consider that everyone usually rolls 3 dice for their [[Checks]] — which use [[Abilities|abilities]] that everyone has — it should become clear that Level 3 represents someone who is 'adequate' at the job in question.

> ### Eg.
>
> Here's a list of job levels and their meanings as they relate to most professional crafts:
>
> 1. **Novice** — You're a complete beginner. Don't worry, everyone starts somewhere. Failing is the easy part. You'll quickly learn from those mistakes.
> 2. **Amateur** — You've had a few goes and find you enjoy the work. From here, you usually either begin to take training seriously, or just keep doing it as a hobby.
> 3. **Apprentice** — You're either doing this regularly enough that you're getting quite good, or you've started studying under someone more experienced. Advancing from here will start to take a while.
> 4. **Itinerant** — You've finished your basic training and now seek professional employment, or perhaps you travel between guilds for additional guidance. (Also known as 'journeyman' level).
> 5. **Adept** — You're really proficient at this. People are starting to seeking your help and guidance on these problems now, rather than the other way around. Heck, they should pay you to do this! Maybe they already do?
> 6. **Expert** — You're the best at this thing among your local peers. The only time you meet people as skilled as you is at big yearly gatherings or conventions. All that's left for you is to to do is seek secret knowledge and hidden techniques from the old [[#Master Levels|masters]], by proving to them you're worthy of attention.

**All jobs start at level 1**, and all characters have every [[D66 Jobs|common job]] pre-listed on the full character sheet. Additional jobs can be added when necessary, simply by adding them to the sheet at level 1. The only exceptions are jobs with requirements, which can only be added at level 1 once those requirements are fulfilled.

#### Zero Dice?

If you are reduced to zero dice to roll on a [[Tasks|Task]] — either due to [[Stress|stress]] or some other reason — **you will automatically fail** it, but you will still gain 2 points of _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_. Or _with the aid of a [[KISSing#Stunts|stunt]] and the FCs approval_ you may roll a single [[Exploding Dice|exploding die]] instead.

![[Earning Experience]]

### Master Levels

To attain _levels beyond six_ and become a 'master' you must fill the exp bar to twelve and then seek training from another master, gain a high-tech augmentation, or otherwise receive a supernatural blessing — all of which require your [[Peers|Peer's approval]].

The number of master levels you can aquire depends on your [[Circumstances#Age|age]]: **Young characters can only have 1 master level, at most, whereas old characters can have up to 4.**

Master levels can be spread out in any way you like — should you be lucky enough to reach such lofty heights — but four master levels is the ordinary mortal limit. If you put all four master levels into one job then you are considered a 'grandmaster'.

❗ Level 10 is absolute maximum job level. _No exceptions._

#### Further Beyond

Once you've filled out all of your master levels, if you still wish to pursue greater knowledge, then the teachings of a master may grant you a new [[Specialties|specialty]] related to that job instead.
