#### Stressful Rolls

Some rolls are deemed 'stressful'. This is a modifier that can be applied to any roll of any difficulty. This indicates that the action is risky, dangerous, or just nerve wracking.

It means that **if you fail the roll**, then in addition to any other consequences you *also* **gain a point of [[Stress]] in the [[Abilities|ability]] or [[Capabilities|capability]] you just rolled with** — or the next most-appropriate ability if your stress for the current one is already full. 

**If your [[Facilitator]] thinks that a roll should be 'stressful' they must say so before you roll**. Should they forget to declare anything before your dice hit the table then your roll is still valid, *it just wasn't that stressful after all*.

#imp However if you roll before the stakes are set, or before the [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]] are discussed, then it *is* invalidated — so don't be too hasty.
