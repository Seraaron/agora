#### Stressful Rolls

Some rolls are deemed 'stressful'. This is a modifier that can be applied to any roll of any difficulty. This indicates that the action is risky, harmful, or just nerve wracking.

**If you fail a stressful roll then you will gain a point of [[Stress]] in the [[Abilities|ability]] or [[Capabilities|capability]] you just rolled with** — or the next most-appropriate ability if your stress for the current one is already full — _in addition to any other consequences_.

❓ **For [[Checks]]**, 'failure' here means a _hard failure_: Zero successes.

![[Dangerous Rolls]]

#### Always Announced

**If your [[Facilitator]] thinks that a roll should be 'stressful' or 'dangerous' they must say so before you roll**. Should they forget to declare anything before your dice hit the table then your roll is still valid, _it just wasn't that bad after all_.

❗ However if you roll before the stakes are set, or before the [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]] are discussed, then it _is_ invalidated — so don't be too hasty.
