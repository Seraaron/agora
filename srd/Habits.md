### Habits

These are **the [[Principles|principles]] that your character repeatedly does**, or ways that they always act _when certain conditions arise_, or things that they do so frequently — or as part of a routine — that they do them without really noticing.

Despite the limited space that you're given to write Habits, try to write them from a first-person perspective and use natural language. You can alsmost think of them as 'character macros', _but try not to write them too programmatically_.

> ### Eg.
>
> - "If I ever feel I'm in danger, I secure my sidearm and ready it." **instead of**, "If in danger, then draw weapon."
> - "Whenever we set out on the road, I like to strike up a song and keep spirits high!" **not**, "While travelling: sing."

#### Habits Break the Normal Rules of Play

Some habits can be written in a way that ensure that your character prioritizes certain things. This can enable you to break the normal rules of play, *just slightly*, in your favor when a Habit applies. This can sometimes avoid the need to make a roll, guarantee to opportunity to react to certain triggers, create a [[Flashbacks|flashback scene]], or may even act as 'insurance' against an adversarial [[Facilitator|FC]].

> ### Nb.
>
> This use of Habits is mainly here to cut out some of the busy-work and minutiae of adventuring, exploration, or downtime, and still be rewarded for doing so, by letting you write Habits like:
>
> - “Always carry enough rope.”
> - “Make time to read at least one book every week.”
> - “I keep my tools sharp and my workshop tidy, so I'm always ready to work.”
> - “Never enter into an agreement or contract without checking all the clauses first.”
> - “I'll restock my ammo at every new town we pass through, so I never run out.”
>
> **That is: _If you have a Habit for it, then it must be true_**.

Habits can _almost_ be thought of as 'proto-[[Specialties|specialties]]', in this way, representing some trait or knack that you've ingrained into yourself. That is, a Habit may allow you to make a [[Fact Checks|Fact check]] or grant some _implicit passive effect_ that **ensures you always have what you need, on hand, to do the things you're best at doing**.

The one thing a Habit _can't be used for_ is [[KISSing]] dice.

❗ A Habit can eventually become a _real_ [[Specialties|specialty]], during a [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|development session feature vote]], if you keep it on your sheet for a whole [[Campaign Arcs|campaign arc]], or longer.

#### Creating Drama with a Habit Generates Ego

At the end of a session, if using a Habit **created interesting drama** then you may regain [[Ego]].

That is, if using the Habit ever puts you in danger, or gets your in trouble; when it creates conflict with another character; when using it has unforeseen consequences; or if it somehow causes you to take [[Stress|stress]].

❗ That said, Habits _aren't supposed to promote or reward disruptive behavior_. Disruptive Habits are called '[[Principles#Duds|duds]]' and should be vetoed-off by your Peers before play.


#### Your Choice!

The choice to invoke a Habit is always _yours and yours alone_, **they don't execute automatically**. Though your [[Peers]] may remind you of them, and you still have to roleplay out the consequences and roll any dice if required.
