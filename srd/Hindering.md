### Hindering Factors

Any character may attempt to sabotage a [[Player Characters|PC]] while they are performing a [[Tasks|Task]], so long as they do so before any dice are rolled, aren't currently preoccupied, and roleplay appropriately:

-   If you are _hindering another player character_ then your meddling **counts as a difficulty factor**.
-   **But hindering someone will _reveal your ill intent_ towards them** _once the dice have fallen and the consequences are wrought_.

Hindering is related to [[Tasks#Opposed Tasks|Opposed tasks]], but _you don't have to hinder someone even when you oppose them_.

> -   **In a symmetrical opposition:** Only a character who isn't directly involved with the roll, and who hasn't already taken a side by helping them, may hinder another side.
> -   **In an asymmetrical opposition:** The defender or their allies may choose to actively hinder the opponent, or they may not. It is up to them.

#### Multiple Hinderers

As with [[Helping#Multiple Helpers|multiple helpers]], if there are multiple helpers then let your [[Peers]] decide what the number of factors should count against you, based on the _approximate number_ of hinderers, as follows:

| â„– of Hinderers | Difficulty Factors |
| :------------: | :----------------: |
|       One      |          1         |
|       Two      |          2         |
|      A Few     |          3         |
|     Several    |          4         |
|     Dozens     |          5         |
|    Hundreds    |          6         |

Unlike [[Helping|helping]], the _quality of hindrance_ is rarely more important than the quantity of hinderers.
