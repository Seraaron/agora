#### Exploding Dice!

**A die is said to 'explode' _if you roll a 6_.** Meaning, you count a success, and then roll another exploding die and see if you get another 6, and so on. Counting successes from all the explosions, using the base [[Rank|rank]] of the roll, until you don't roll another 6.

Exploding dice are also sometimes called 'open-ended' dice, mainly in reference to [[Tags List|gear tags]], so that the #explosive tag and the #open-ended tag are not confused.

#imp **_Exploded_ dice cannot be [[KISSing|KISSed]]**, but dice that have yet to explode _can be_.

##### Explosive Sources

**Magic (or sufficiently-advanced technologies) are generally what makes dice explode!** As such, exploding dice is a rare and powerful mechanic that should be awarded sparingly.

The only 'naturally magic' job in the base game is the [[Mage]] job, which uses it's own [[magical subsystem]] for determining factors (and which also partly justifies _the need_ for its dice to be open-ended, because the total number of difficulty factors can sometimes exceed 10).
