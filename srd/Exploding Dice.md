#### Exploding Dice!

**A die is said to 'explode' _if you roll a 6_.** Meaning, you count a success, and then roll another exploding die and see if you get another 6, and so on. Counting successes from all the explosions, using the base [[Rank|rank]] of the roll, until you don't roll another 6.

**_Exploded_ dice cannot be [[KISSing|KISSed]]**, but dice that have yet to explode _can be_.

❗  If you spend [[Ego]] on an exploding roll then it adds **bonus dice equal to your [[Health]]** *instead of doubling any 6s*. 

##### Explosive Sources

**Magics (or sufficiently-advanced technologies) are generally what makes dice explode.** As such, exploding dice is a rare and powerful effect that should be awarded sparingly. If a job or item has either the #magic tag or the #high-tech tag, then any dice rolled with it can explode.

There are only a few 'naturally magic' jobs in the base game — [[Alchemist]], [[Augur*]], [[Mage*]], [[Mystic*]], and [[Shapeshifter*]] — and they each use their own sub-systems for determining difficulty factors. This also partly justifies _the need_ for them to be open-ended, because the total number of difficulty factors can sometimes exceed 10.

##### Backlash

Failing a roll with explosive dice should always have some backlash for the user, so that they are highly risky but also highly rewarding. All #magic job rolls are [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]], for example, and some have other failure conditions too.
