# Finding your Agenda

During play, once it is decided that [[When to roll dice|you should roll dice]], your [[Facilitator]] will pause the [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]] and begin to _openly discuss your agenda_ for that roll. In other words, **talk about what you're trying to achieve and _why?_**

Coming up with an agenda each [[Session Structure#Turns|turn]] can be a _complex and personal_ process — everyone will do it slightly differently, because everyone thinks differently.

> ### Nb.
>
> **The following are some questions you can ask yourself if you're feeling stuck:**
>
> - Look to your [[Principles|principles]], and think about which ones are currently motivating you the most, or which ones can apply directly to what's happening right now?
> - What are your [[Circumstances|circumstances]] and [[Conditions|conditions]], and do any of them help to prompt you to roleplay in a certain way?
> - What are your friends and allies trying to achieve right now, and can you [[Helping|help]] them, or _perhaps_ should you try to hinder them?
> - Check your [[Jobs|jobs]] and [[Specialties|specialties]], [[Assets and Gear|assets or gear]], and [[Taking notes|notes]], and wonder if any of them can be used creatively to achieve what you want?
> - Question your [[Facilitator|FC]] about your environment or the current situation, see if they've forgotten to mention anything useful, or if they will yield more information if you ask the right questions or act a certain way in-game?
> - Ask your [[Peers]] for help to parse your thoughts and formulate a plan?

## Actions and Objectives

Once your agenda is clear, it's time to think about how it translates into an **action** in order to fulfill an **objective**.

- The objective is _what_ your character wants and _when_ they want it. You can even have multiple objectives. These are your intentions.
- The action is _how_ your character gets it, or _who_ they need to talk to and _what they say_. This is what you must test in order to succeed.

These will each partially depend on [[Using Checks and Tasks|what kind of roll]] you'll be making, a [[Checks|Check]] or a [[Tasks|Task]]: Checks can only be used to complete a single, simple, objective. Whereas Tasks can fulfill multiple objectives at once using the same action (or a set of similar actions).

Strictly speaking, this is _all just a natural part of roleplaying_. You generally won't call full attention to these individual components unless you're really struggling to put it into words and need this structure to help you gather your thoughts, or unless your [[Facilitator|FC]] needs help working out what the [[Difficulties and Consequences|difficulty and consequences]] of your actions should be.

❓ Remember that taking some time out to think about or discuss these things with your [[Peers]] _doesn't detract from the game_, you're still playing even if you're not directly 'in character'.
