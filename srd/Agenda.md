# Finding your Agenda

During play, once it is decided that [[When to roll dice|you should roll dice]], your [[Facilitator]] will pause the scene and begin to _openly discuss your agenda_ for that roll. In other words, **talk about what you're trying to achieve and how?**

Coming up with an agenda each [[Session Structure#Turns|turn]] can be a _complex and personal_ process; everyone will do it slightly differently, because everyone thinks differently.

> **The following are some questions you can ask yourself if you're feeling stuck:**
>
> -   Look to your [[Principles|principles]], and think about which ones are currently motivating you the most, or which ones can apply directly to what's happening right now?
> -   What are your [[Circumstances|circumstances]] and [[Conditions|conditions]], and do any of them help to prompt you to roleplay in a certain way?
> -   What are your friends and allies trying to achieve right now, and can you [[Helping|help]] them, or _perhaps_ should you try to hinder them?
> -   Check your [[Jobs|jobs]] and [[Specialties|specialties]], [[Assets and Gear|assets or gear]], and [[Taking notes|notes]], and wonder if any of them can be used creatively to achieve what you want?
> -   Question your [[Facilitator|FC]] about your environment or the current situation, see if they've forgotten to mention anything useful, or if they will yield more information if you ask the right questions or act a certain way in-game?
> -   Ask your [[Peers]] for help to parse your thoughts and formulate a plan?
