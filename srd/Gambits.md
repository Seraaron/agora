# Gambits

#### Effect Levels

_The advanced effect of a commonplace gambit is roughly on par with the basic effects of extraordinary gambits, and the advanced effects of extraordinary gambits are roughly on par with the basic effects of supernatural gambits._

**Upgrading from a basic gambit to the advanced version costs the same as taking a new gambit** — [insert cap cost here] #rewrite — _but it does not take up a new gambit slot_.

When you write the Gambit name on your sheet, you can write the effect level as a single letter in parentheses next to its name to indicate whether it's basic or advanced (ie. B or A).

❓ The categories are just an organization device, they have no mechanical meaning. **It is up to individual [[Facilitator|FCs]] to restrict access to certain gambits** if they feel they do not fit the [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]] of their game.

#### Effect Durations

**Each gambit is listed with a duration in the heading row.** The durations are:

- **Instant** — Can be used _once per session_, and the effects are applied immediately (or to an upcoming roll). If you prefer a stricter refresh period, you may say they can only be used once per day instead.
- **Round, Scene, or Session** — Can _only be used once per session_, but lasts until the end of the given time-frame (applying to all relevant rolls made in that period). If you prefer to use more strict time-frames, you may use a minute, an hour, or a day instead, respectively.
- **Constant** — Always active, _or always activatable_, or provides a passive effect, with no major restrictions unless specified in the text of the gambit.

- every gambit costs the same amount of caps, regardless of tier
	- but the gambits you can take are restricted by your character tier
- some gambits have powers that upgrade when you upgrade tier, whereas others just do their one thing and do it well
	- gambit effects are somewhere between wod 'merits', pbta 'moves', 13th age 'powers', and exalted 'charms'
- you must use Ego to use them
	- but i'm not sure if it should Ego and a Check and then two options for success and failure
	- or whether it should just be use Ego and it works
- there's also some thematic ties that make tiers comparable to mythic concepts like 'cultivation'
	- which i should probably both emphasize and draw inspiration from when it comes to writing gambits
- gambits are probably not core to this game, which means that tier is probably not core either

## Tiers

**tier names:** Ordinary, Heroic (wuxia), Mythic (xuanhuan / mixed), and Immortal (xianxia).

#unfinished

different gambits (or maybe scars) change how you recover from stress?
