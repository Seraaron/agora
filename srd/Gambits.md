# Gambits

Gambits are special perks, gifts, or powers that your character has access to. They may be inherited or earned, or they can develop over time. They help to distinguish characters from one another, and can give them a unique thing to do — that only they (or their kin) are capable of.

**Not all gambits are explicitly magical in nature**, some can be acquired via augmentation, mutation, or training, but they can all be considered a _kind of magic_. There are three broad categories of gambits to help you to distinguish them from one another and to set the 'power-level' for your campaign: **[[Gambits List#Commonplace Gambits|Commonplace]]**, **[[Gambits List#Extraordinary|Extraordinary]]**, and **[[Gambits List#Supernatural|Supernatural]]**.

❓ These categories are just an organization device, they have no mechanical meaning. **It is up to individual [[Facilitator|FCs]] to restrict access to certain gambits** if they feel they do not fit the [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|tone]] of their game.

## Effects

Gambit effects are written in two short paragraphs, usually. Some of them are intentionally _vague and evocative_, leaving some of the work to you and your table to interpret them and apply the imagined results to your game. Whereas others are _more specific_, and explicitly grant bonus dice to certain rolls, or make those rolls [[Exploding Dice|explode]], or otherwise break the normal rules of play.

**The most important thing about gambit effects is that they _just work_.** There are no almost no prerequisites, no preliminary rolls to make, or resources that you have to spend to use them. So long as you're in the right position to physically do what they say they let you do, then you can do it.

❗ This differentiates gambits from [[Spellcasting|spells]], for example, which would usually require a successful [[Mage*]] roll to perform.

❓ If you don't want _any_ magic in your setting, it may still be worth checking over the basic effects of the [[Gambits List#Commonplace Gambits|Commonplace gambits list]] as most of these can be interpreted as 'natural talents'.

### Effect Grades

Each of the two paragraphs that describe a gambit's effects can be divided into two grades: **Basic** or **Advanced**.

> ### Ie.
>
> The advanced effect of a commonplace gambit is roughly _on par_ with the basic effects of an extraordinary gambit, and the advanced effects of extraordinary gambits are roughly _on par_ with the basic effects of supernatural gambits.

**Upgrading from a basic gambit to the advanced version costs the same as taking a new gambit** — 12 [[Character Assembly#4 Character Assembly Points|caps]] — _but it does not take up a new [[#Slots|gambit slot]]_.

When you write the Gambit name on your sheet, you can write the effect's grade as a single letter in parentheses next to its name to indicate whether it's basic or advanced (ie. B or A).

### Effect Durations

**Each gambit is listed with a duration in the heading row of its effect table.** The durations are:

- **Instant** — Can be used _once per session_, and the effects are usually applied immediately (or to an upcoming roll).
- **Round, Scene, or Session** — Can _only be used once per session_, but lasts until the end of the given time-frame (applying to all relevant rolls made in that period), given in the description.
- **Constant** — Always active, _or always activatable_, or provides a passive effect, with no major restrictions unless specified in the description.

If you prefer to use more strict time-frames, you may use a minute, an hour, or a day, instead of a round, scene, or session, respectively.

## Slots

By default, **characters have three gambit slots.** These are the spaces provided on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]] to write down the gambits you've taken during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]]. _There should also be enough space to write a summary of their [[#Effects|effects]]._

❓ It _is_ possible to have more than three gambits in total, _with your [[Peers]] permission_, but then you must choose at the start of each session which three gambits you want to make 'active' and available to you for use during that same session — a decision that should be informed by your [[Principles|principles]] and expected [[Agenda|agendas]] for the session.

❗ Only the [[Facilitator|FC]] can increase a character's slot limit, since it will increase that character's total effectiveness and potency. This can be discussed during [[Development Sessions|development sessions]].
