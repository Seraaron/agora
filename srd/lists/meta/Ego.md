## Ego

**You either have Ego, or you don't**, at any given time.

> #nb
> Ego represents _quite literally_ your character's sense of self, and also the part of their psyche that believes they have control over their own reality. _Ego is a force:_ A force that makes the world conform to your vision.

Every character starts the game with Ego, unless you choose to start with an extra +1d6 Lots instead. You can represent whether you currently have Ego or not by filling in or erasing the diamond (◇ ↔ ◆) on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], using the faces of a coin or a playing card, or using some other kind of binary token.

### Spending Ego

-   **Spending Ego on a roll counts all your 6s _twice_**.
    -   Meaning that your all 6s effectively turn into double-successes.
    -   This should be done as a part of [[KISSing]], but cannot be used on [[Exploding Dice|exploded dice]].

-   Ego may also used to 'fuel' the most potent effects of certain [[Gambits]].

#### _Optional:_ Changing Consequences

Ego can be spent outside of rolls to influence the narrative in larger ways: Namely, to alter or delay a [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequence]] (usually from a previous scene or interaction) right as it's about to rear its head.

**This doesn't _entirely prevent_ the consequence from occurring**, it either _delays the inevitable_ or just _changes it out for something equally bad_. This can dramatically change the current situation in just about any way that your [[Facilitator|FC]] and [[Peers]] agree is appropriate, so feel free to experiment.

### Earning Ego

There are four main ways to earn back your Ego immediately during play, and only one way to earn it back the end of a session. Each option may only be used _once per session per player_, but that's still a potential of five Ego that you can earn and spend each session if you play your cards just right:

-   **When you limiting yourself with a [[Conditions|condition]] and _succeeding_ at the resulting roll**.
-   **When using a [[Habits]] presents an unforeseen dilemma**, causes you to take [[Stress|stress]], embarrasses or disturbs someone, _or otherwise creates interesting drama_.
-   **When you crack an in-character joke with good comedic timing**, or otherwise acting in a way that breaks the tension and _makes everyone at the table laugh or relax_ (even if the characters in the game don't find it so funny).
-   **When you 'cash-in' a condition**, for which you have _already experienced [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]_, removing it from your sheet in exchange for Ego.

And

- **At the [[End-of-Session Rewards|end of a session]], if you've completed a [[Goals|goal]],** then take a point of Ego.

###### Convert excess Ego to Lots

_If you would have earned Ego_, but already have it, then take a [[Lots|Lot]] instead. (And if you're already full up on Lots too, then add a point of _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_ to a job of your choice instead).
