## Fidelity

**Fidelity is a gauge that _slowly ticks up to four_, and then it resets.**

> #nb
> Fidelity represents a measure of your long-term success at establishing and upholding _your truth_ — your version of reality — whatever that may be, and for whatever good or ill that it may bring to others. Fidelity is the _quintessence of kismet;_ the stuff that lets you reach [[Tier#Mythic Tier|mythic]] levels of excellence.

Characters do not normally start with any Fidelity. Fidelity changes infrequently, and it progresses in two stages, so it is best to represent earning it by filling in the white diamonds first with a small black diamond, on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], and then with a full diamond when you spend it (i.e ◇ → ◈ → ◆).


### Spending Fidelity

Each point of Fidelity is spent in *two ways over its lifetime:*
- First is when [[KISSing]], you may **spend a point of Fidelity to _temporarily advance_ the [[rank]] of the ability you're using by one step**; potentially letting you count some extra successes on the roll, and lasting for the rest of the scene.
	- When you do this, you should fill in the partially-filled diamond (◈ → ◆).
- Then *once the whole gauge is full*, you may **spend it at any dramatically appropriate time to _permanently advance_ the rank of any one of your abilities by one step**.
	- This drains the gauge and starts the whole process over again (◆◆◆◆ → ◇◇◇◇).

### Earning Fidelity

**You earn Fidelity by not faltering in your [[Creeds]]** as they are [[Challenging Principles|challenged]] by your [[Facilitator]], over the course of many sessions.

Fidelity is usually only gained during [[Development Sessions|development sessions]], usually at the end of an [[Campaign Arcs#Arcs|arc]].

Your FC should ask you _**"Which of your creeds have not faltered?"**_, to which you should respond by reading them all aloud and letting your [[Peers]] press you further and point to times when they think you _may_ have faltered:

- **If you can defend your position and convince them, and prove that a belief is unwavering or that your [[Creeds#Oaths|oath]] is unbroken, _then and only then_ do you earn the Fidelity**.

- **If you find that a creed *has* wavered**, or if you already know that one has [[Health#Healing|changed to regain Health]], **then you gain a new [[Specialties|specialty]] instead**. This specialty should be related to the experiences that lead to your changed creed, and can be discussed or [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|voted on]] like any other character feature. 

**Once you have earned Fidelity, it cannot be taken away.** Changing or removing a creed after carrying it for so long does not make you weaker. Altering the wording of a creed immediately after earning Fidelity from it (but keeping the same message, or pointing it in a new direction) is also fine.
