### Habits

These are **[[Principles]] that your character repeatedly does**, or ways that they always act _when certain conditions arise_, or things that they do so frequently (or as part of a routine) that they do them without really noticing.

Despite the limited space that you're given to write habits, try to write them from a first-person perspective and use natural language. Try not to write them too 'programmatically'.

> #eg
> -   "If I ever feel I'm in danger, I secure my sidearm and ready it." **instead of**, "If in danger, then draw weapon."
> -   "Whenever we set out on the road, I like to strike up a song and keep spirits high!" **not**, "While travelling: sing."

#### Using Habits

Habits have two main uses, but they are quite versatile and you may find or make up other uses through experimentation and play. Generally, _the way that you intend to use a habit usually informs the way you should write it_, but there's nothing stopping a habit from being used in multiple ways at once:

-   _Once per session_ **when a habit creates interesting drama, you may regain [[Ego]]**. That is, if using it ever puts you (or an ally) in danger, when it creates conflict with another character, when using it has unforeseen consequences, or if it somehow causes you to take [[Stress|stress]].
-   **Habits can be used as 'proto-specialties'**. That is, a habit may allow you to make [[Fact Checks|Fact checks]] or grant some *implicit passive effect* that **ensures you always have what you need, on hand, to do the things you're best at doing**.
	-   What a habit *can't do* — that a [[Specialties|specialty]] can — is be used to [[KISSing|KISS]] dice.
	-   Still, this means that you can test the waters with a certain play-style that you intend to try to turn into a _real_ specialty, the next time there's [[Downtime and Travel]] or a [[Development Sessions|development session]].
	-   Or you can just write a habit to suit you for a specific scenario and then change it out once the situation changes.


> #nb
> The second use of habits is mainly here to cut out some of the busy-work and minutiae of adventuring, exploration, or downtime, by letting you write habits like:
>
> -   "I always carry enough rope."
> -   "Make time to read at least one book every week."
> -   "I keep my tools sharp and my workshop tidy, so I'm always ready to work."
>
> **That is: _If you have a habit for it, then it must be true_**.

#imp Habits *aren't* supposed to promote or reward disruptive behavior. Disruptive habits are called '[[Principles#Duds|duds]]' and should be vetoed-off by your Peers before play.

#### Your Choice!

The choice to invoke a habit is always _yours and yours alone_, **they don't execute automatically**. Though your [[Peers]] may remind you of them, and you still have to roleplay out the consequences and roll any dice if required.
