### Exclusive Features

Every character has an exclusive feature (or sometimes simply an 'exclusive' for short). This is a trait, phrase, or other special [[Circumstances|circumstance]], an unusual [[Specialties|specialty]] or [[Features|gambit]], a rare [[Conditions|condition]], or perhaps even an inherited  [[Assets and Gear|asset]], that is **unique to you in some fashion**. No other [[Player Characters|Player Character]] can have the same exclusive feature as you, but if want it to be a possibility then you can indicate to your [[Facilitator]] that other [[Non-player Characters|NPCs]] *potentially could*.

> There are a few ways of interpreting this, *in decreasing order of exclusivity*, and which you choose will really depend on your setting and the sort of story you're trying to tell:
> -  The feature is exclusive to you personally, meaning that *you're only person in the world with this feature* (at least that you know of).
> - It's exclusive to your species, kinsfolk, family, culture, or members of your faith.
> - The feature is only exclusive within a meta-context as it relates to the rest of your party, and simply means that no other [[Player Characters|PC]] can have something similar.

Functionally, the feature works like any other of it's type — if it's a specialty then it can be used to make [[Fact Checks|Fact checks]] or [[KISSing|KISS]] dice, for example, and gives you a passive use akin to an extra [[Habits|habit]] — except that it's *completely free*, no matter how powerful it seems, the only catch is that **you must get your [[Facilitator|FC's]] approval before adding it to your sheet**. 

Therefore, the best exclusive features are also usually tied to your [[Character Assembly#1 Concept Concept Concept|character concept]] in some way, so that you can justify it to your FC. In fact, depending on how it's phrased your exclusive *can literally be* your concept in some cases.

> #eg 
> - I can talk to trees, and they can talk back to me.
> - I am a Starchild, born from the DNA sequencing of distant nebulae as my father.
> - I am no man, I am Three-Wolves. (I am three wolves).
> - #unfinished 

What exclusive features like these do *exactly* is unimportant at this stage, if your FC likes the idea then it gives them grist to build out the setting, and they can tie future plot points to the exclusive feature if that's something you're interested in. Otherwise, these 'features-as-phrases' can just work like a specialty for the most part — allowing you to establish facts about your exclusive feature as you play.

#### Other Uses

Aside from any mechanical uses that the feature itself has, there's always going to be an *implicit side-effect* to having something so special. You can make a big change to the rest of the world with a very simple choice of words.

> #eg 
> - I am the only cishet person in the world.
> -
