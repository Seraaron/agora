## Health

**You start with two Health**, best represented by filling in the diamonds (ie. ◇◇ → ◆◆) on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], since it changes fairly infrequently.

> #nb
> Health represents both your physical and mental well-being, your capacity to continue fighting for what you believe in, and a measure of your _life energy_. It is a complex stat, which can be damaged and healed; but _that damage always leave a mark_.

If your [[Peers]] allow it, you may opt to start the game with only one Health point, and instead _start with a point of Fidelity and an active [[Wounds and Scars|wound]];_ representing something in your character's recent past that they stood up for and were injured because of.

### Cheating Death

When you are faced with deathly consequences, you may **spend a Health point to escape with your life**: You [[Wounds and Scars|take a wound]], _instead of dying_.

The way you cheat death may be described in any way you feel is fitting for the situation, but feel free to open up the discussion to your [[Peers]] if you're feeling stuck. Whatever the case, you survive what _should have been_ a fatal situation.

> #eg
> It may be that some dramatically appropriate complication arises, which throws everything you thought you knew into turmoil; or that a friend saves you at the last moment; or that your sheer force of will and disregard for death carries you through; or perhaps it's just dumb luck.

### Healing

**You regain a Health die when you come to a point of inner turmoil** — playing through that conflict in an engaging manner — **and, in turn, _change one of your [[Creeds]]_ to reflect your new stance**. Once you give up on something you believed in, let it burn, and start trying to move in a new direction, _that_ is when you recover your Health.

**Put another way:** _You only heal when you change your mind_.

**Changing a creed in this way will _exclude the possibility of earning [[Fidelity]] from it_**, at the end of the [[Campaign Arcs|arc]], but you will gain a [[Specialties|specialty]] related to your death-defying experience instead.

> #nb
> It is possible to recover from a wound without regaining your Health. Getting a wound and losing health are caused by the same event (ie. almost dying), but they heal in different ways.
>
> **See also:** [[Conditions#Convalescence]]

#que You can _technically_ change your mind back again (in another arc) to a previously abandoned Creed, but only if it makes and your [[Peers]] agree.

### Dying
If you are wounded, _and you refuse to change your mind to heal_, and then get hurt again but still want to live, then you will drop to zero Health (ie. ◇◇). **You don't immediately die at zero Health, but you _will fall unconscious and start dying!_**

#### You Will Die at 0 Health, *unless...*
**If your character is dying** then — aside from the immediate and debilitating effects of having *two [[Wounds and Scars|wounds]]* — **they will _actually die_ before the end of the session, _unless they change their mind about something_.** Once you're back up to at least 1 Health you regain consciousness and you can then think about getting [[Medical Treatment|treatment]] for your wounds.

Similarly, **you will die _if you are faced with death but refuse to spend your Health to cheat it_**, or if you are faced with deathly consequences _again_ while you're already dying.

###### Death is not 'The End'

_Many stories involve death._ Some campaigns will involve it more than others, some will involve death not at all. Be sure that you have your [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]] in place before potentially killing a character, or letting one die. Ultimately, Health is an _additional consent tool_ that ensures that **when a character _does_ die, they die for a good reason**.

If your character dies, you can make a new one during a [[Development Sessions|development session]] and they will be able to join the campaign again in the next [[Campaign Arcs|arc]], or *maybe even as soon as the next session if the opportunity arises*.
