##### _Optional:_ Flashbacks

**It's also possible for a [[Habits|habit]] to briefly cut back to an earlier point in the current scene**, _or even cut to a previously-nonexistent scene:_ When something happens, and you realize that one of your habits would have been useful and that it should've changed the way that you behaved, or if it would change what your current plans are. _Though this only works with your [[Facilitator|FC's]] approval_.

#question The technique of using 'flashbacks' was popularized in Blades in the Dark, but not everyone finds them useful or engaging, so it's worth discussing with your [[Peers]] whether you want to allow habits to be used in this way during [[Development Sessions#Session Zero|session zero]].
