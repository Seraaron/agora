## Tier

Different types of character concepts can be grouped under different 'tiers'. These tiers are like archetypal roles that set the base 'power level' for that character, and it may be that certain [[Character Assembly#Concept Concept Concept|character concepts]] simply won't make sense at certain tiers. Therefore, **everyone should make characters of the same tier**, unless you have your [[Peers]] permission to make a character of a different tier from them.

The four tiers, from lowest to highest, are: **Ordinary**, **Heroic**, **Legendary**, and **Mythic**.

#question Write your tier in parentheses next to your campaign's name on your character sheet. (You can only [[Development Sessions#Changing Tier|advance your tier]] during [[Development Sessions|development sessions]]).

##### Tier Benefits:

| Tier          | Ability Rank Array | Bonus ¢aps* |
| ------------- |:------------------:|:-----------:|
| **Ordinary**  |  5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4  |     +0      |
| **Heroic**    |  5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3  |     +20     |
| **Legendary** |  4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3  |     +40     |
| **Mythic**    |  4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2  |     +70     |

#asterisk Only for creating characters from scratch, flatpacks have these bonus points already accounted for.

The 'ability rank array' is a set of numbers that you should spread out among your [[Rank|ability ranks]], assigning one number to each ability, and the subsequent 'bonus ranks' means that two or three of the numbers in that array can be raised by an extra rank (ie. 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2). The bonus 'caps' — character assembly points — may be spent at any stage of [[Character Assembly|character creation]] to give your character a few extra treats.

#important Each ability **can't be advanced more than once** with these bonus ranks.

> ### Eg.
> #rewrite 
> An 'ordinary tier' character could have an ability spread like this:
> ![[example_correctAbilities.png]]
>
> #### Ie. {5, 6-1, 6; 4, 5, 4-1}
>
> But not like this:
> ![[example_incorrectAbilities.png]]
>
> #### Ie. {5, 6, 6; 4, 5, 4-2}

#question You don't have to assign your ability ranks until the end of the character assembly process, since your decision will be partially informed by the jobs you decide to take, so feel free to come back to this step later.

###### Tiers Explained

-   **Ordinary tier** represents fairly historically accurate characters acting in an assumedly normal world. It represents people like you and I, most likely, and nearly everyone else who has ever lived and died on Earth.

-   **Heroic tier** is for playing out believable tales about people who quest for glory or struggle to leave their mark on the annals of history, want to change or create new culture, or become living legends; whose efforts may not have been really possible without either a story-teller's embellishments or a true touch of magic.

-   **Legendary tier** is the place of gifted-rogues, warrior-poets, adventurer-prophets, philosopher-engineers, and sorcerer-monarchs; where paranormal events occur regularly, wishes are sometimes fulfilled, and epic deeds may occasionally be performed.

-   **Mythic tier** characters may be ascended mortals, real-life superheroes, daimons or demigods, or a shard of a greater deity given mortal form. They are not omnipotent or flawless beings though, their actions still have [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]], and there is still room for them to grow and learn from the world before their apotheosis (or inevitable doom).
