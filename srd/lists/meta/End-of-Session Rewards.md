#### End-of-Session Rewards

During the [[Wrap Up|wrap up meeting]] of every session, each of you should ask and answer the following questions and take a [[Lots|Lot]] for each one that you can answer 'yes' to and explain your reasoning for (subject to [[Peers|Peer]] approval):
-   **Have any of your [[Goals|goals]] notably advanced this session?** Either though a purely narrative interaction or _codified within the results of a roll_.
	-   If the goal was *completed* then you may take a point of [[Ego]] instead.
-   **Did you feel adequately challenged by what your [[Facilitator|FC]] had laid out for you today?** That is, did you have to make any tough decisions that you were not expecting, or were there any moments when you were tempted to deviate from your [[Creeds|creeds]].
-   **Have any of your character's [[Circumstances|circumstances]] driven play this session?** This is for _really embodying a particular trait_ and doing it justice or representing it well in play, or if you can point to a moment when using it to your advantage probably avoided a roll.
-   **Can you tell us something that _something new that your character learned_ about the world or another character today?** (If so, then [[Taking notes|write it down]]). Alternatively if you can list something that you — _the player_ — learned about your character, the game, or the world, that you did not realize until you played them a certain way or encountered a certain scenario.

Each player can earn *at most* **4 Lots per session** from these questions, even if they have multiple good answers to the same question.
