## Lots

**You can have _up to eight_ Lots at a time**.

> #nb
> Lots represent the smallest parcel of fate that a player can use to manipulate their character's destiny. You can think of them as _tiny cosmic favors_ that you can trade to influence the dice, like cashing in a bit of karma.

Every character starts the game with 1d6 Lots, or you may _take the average_ and start with 3 Lots. Lots can be represented on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] by filling in or erasing the diamonds (◇ ↔ ◆), or by using glass beads, the faces of an eight-sided die, or some other kind of token.

### Spending Lots

-   **Spending a Lot on a roll counts as a [[KISSing|KISS]]**, letting you re-roll a die of your choice _with no questions asked_. The first Lot spent on every [[Tasks|Task]] roll also converts into [[Earning Experience|exp]] for the [[Jobs|job]] you're using on that roll. 
-   During an [[Opposed Tasks#Asymmetrical Opposition|Asymmetrically opposed task]], you can also **spend Lots to add arbitrary difficulty factors**, making success harder for your opponent.
-   Lastly, you may **convert Lots into [[Earning Experience|exp]]** for any [[Jobs|jobs]] of your choice during downtime or between sessions, or *if your are ever about to exceed the eight Lots maximum*.

### Earning Lots

There are four ways to earn Lots back during a session, and four way to earn them at the end of each session. So you generally won't exceed eight Lots unless you trigger the in-session rewards multiple times per session, or just aren't using your opportunities to spend them.

#### In-Session Rewards

Gain a Lot *immediately*, whenever any these things occur:

-   **When you limit yourself with a [[Conditions|condition]] and _fail the resulting roll_**.
-   **When you get an inspired idea or have a _'eureka' moment_**.
	-   Your [[Facilitator|FC]] may reward good lateral thinking and creative solutions — *especially when it's something they didn't think of* — to help to encourage you to give it go.
-   **When you [[Discovering Principles|discover]] a new [[Principles|principle]] during session.**
-   **When you 'take the lead' from your FC and _introduce a slower-paced roleplaying-centered_ [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]]**.
	-   This is usually a scene where you talk a lot with an [[Non-player Characters|NPC]] or a fellow [[Player Characters|Player Character]], and take the time to describe some of the set-dressing and mood.
	-   [[Stress#Stress Relieving Scenes|Stress relef scenes]] and [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis scenes]] are a good candidate for these kinds of moments.
	-   Alternatively, this can serve as a general reward for _any time you make the experience of play more collaborative_.
