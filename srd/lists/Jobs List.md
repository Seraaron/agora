# Jobs List

Use the following list of job tags to help you search for jobs of a similar type:

| Job tags:    |           |            |           |          |          |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| #academic    | #animal   | #artistic  | #athletic | #civic   | #craft   |
| #financial   | #intrigue | #laborious | #magic    | #martial | #medical |
| #performance | #ritual   | #rogue     | #social   | #vehicle | #vessel  |

Don't worry too much about the meaning of each job tag — they're just here to help with searching and grouping — **they have no inherent mechanical effect**, except for #magic (which makes dice rolls [[Exploding Dice|explode]]).

Jobs also have _alternative names_ hidden in their metadata, which may also make them easier to search for.

❓ The numbers in curly braces, {like this}, at the end of some job descriptions reference that job's position in the [[D66 Jobs|D66 common jobs table]].

###### Inventing New Jobs

Making up new jobs is possible, usually by just taking the verb you want to perform and converting it to it's noun form, and then deciding on which ability it should be associated with. Use the verb lists given in the [[Abilities|abilities]] article to help you decide which one fits best, or in rare cases you may use a [[Capabilities|capability]] instead.

_Thinking of the job's name is often the hardest part_, but sometimes there's a perfectly good noun that already exists that describes the job your thinking of without needing to fiddle around with suffixes. Using a thesaurus is recommended at this point.

Although every job should come with a short definition for clarity, written in the present tense, the use-case of every job should be fairly self-explanatory. Still, it's a good idea to **try to design new jobs that don't overlap too much with existing ones**. Make sure you have a really clear idea about what your new job would do and what sorts of situations it might be used in, and always run a job you've invented past your [[Peers]] before adding it to the game.

From there, learning the newly invented job is the same process as learning any other job (see above), either during [[Character Assembly]] or mid session, as is needed.
