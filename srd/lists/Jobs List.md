###### Inventing New Jobs

Making up new jobs is possible, usually by just taking the verb you want to perform and converting it to it's noun form, and then deciding on which ability it should be associated with. Use the verb lists given in the [[Abilities|abilities]] article to help you decide which one fits best, or in rare cases you may use a [[Capabilities|capability]] instead.

_Thinking of the job's name is often the hardest part_, but sometimes there's a perfectly good noun that already exists that describes the job your thinking of without needing to fiddle around with suffixes. Using a thesaurus is recommended at this point.

Although every job should come with a short definition for clarity, written in the present tense, the use-case of every job should be fairly self-explanatory. Still, it's a good idea to **try to design new jobs that don't overlap too much with existing ones**. Make sure you have a really clear idea about what your new job would do and what sorts of situations it might be used in, and always run a job you've invented past your [[Peers]] before adding it to the game.

From there, learning the newly invented job is the same process as learning any other job (see above), either during [[Character Assembly]] or mid session, as is needed.
