### Vehicles & Vessels

**All vehicles and vessels have the #vehicle or #vessel tags.** These objects blur the line between being gear or [[Assets and Gear|assets]]. They can often be as expensive as buildings, but they usually have more utility in immediate gameplay terms, so they're listed here as gear.

**Unlike [[#Tools|tools]] however:** If a job says it requires a vehicle or vessel to be used _and you don't have one_, then it simply cannot be used.

#### Animals

**All animals have the #animal tag.** Animals are grouped in two ways: Pets and Livestock. Individual pets count as 'items of gear', whereas livestock animals are collectively treated more like [[Assets and Gear|assets]].

A pet can be trained and looked after using the [[Handler]] job. A pets is different from a [[Familiar]] though. Pets are just animal companions, or may be treated like tools or vehicles in some instances; whereas a familiar is a [[VINPCs|VINPC]] granted by a [[Gambits|gambit]] that has their own specialties and limited sapience.

‚ùó Animals can get [[Assets and Gear#Breaking Gear|damaged]] just like any other piece of gear, but in this case you don't 'repair' them. They must be treated with the [[Handler]] job, and given time to heal, or else they can die.
