### Armor

**All armor has the #armor tag.** Add your armor dice to the _first part_ of your [[Martial Combat#Poise|poise]] calculation.

You suffer a +1 difficulty factor to all rolls related to stealth and mobility while wearing armor, though these penalties are negated by #quiet and #flexible, respectively.

| Dice | #armor                                       |    Weight    | Additional Tags          | ₡ost |
| ---- | :------------------------------------------- | :----------: | ------------------------ | ---: |
| +2   | **Padded Buff / Gambeson / Leather Jerkin**  |    #light    | #flexible #quiet         |  12¢ |
| +2   | **Silk Robes / Ribbed Corset / Flak Jacket** |    #light    | #flexible #secret #quiet |  15¢ |
| +2   | **Thick Cloak / Furs 'n' Hides**             |    #light    | #quiet #secret #warming  |  15¢ |
| +3   | **Breastplate / Cuirass**                    |    #medium   | #hardened #quiet #secret |  20¢ |
| +3   | **Discplate / Mirror Armor**                 |    #heavy    | #hardened                |  12¢ |
| +3   | **Scalemail / Lamellar / Splintmail**        |    #medium   | #flexible                |  12¢ |
| +4   | **Chainmail Hauberk**                        |    #medium   | #flexible #secret        |  20¢ |
| +4   | **Brigandine / Coat o' Plates**              |    #heavy    | #flexible #hardened      |  20¢ |
| +5   | **Platemail / Plate 'n' Chain**              | #super-heavy | #hardened                |  24¢ |
| +6   | **Fully Articulated Plate**                  | #super-heavy | #flexible #hardened      |  35¢ |

#question The dice ratings start at +2 because 1 die is equivalent to [[#Natural Armor|natural]] (unarmored) human skin.

### Helmets

**All helmets have the #helm tag.** Add your helm dice to the _middle part_ of your [[Martial Combat#Poise|poise]] calculation.

Helmets are generally cheaper than armor while still providing decent protection, and they can still be used with your [[Acrobat]] level if you're unarmored, making them a good choice for adventurers on a budget. They offer no damage reduction against [[Spur|spur]] attacks though.

| Dice | #helm                           |  Weight | Additional Tags   | ₡ost |
| ---- | :------------------------------ | :-----: | ----------------- | ---: |
| +1   | **Padded Cap / Fur Helm**       |  #light | —                 |   4¢ |
| +1   | **Turban / Wide-Brim Hat**      |  #light | #secret           |   6¢ |
| +2   | **Open-faced Helmet**           | #medium | —                 |   6¢ |
| +2   | **Crested Helm / Brimmed Helm** |  #light | #crested          |   9¢ |
| +3   | **Closed-face Helmet**          |  #heavy | #closed           |  12¢ |
| +3   | **Masked Helm / Great Helm**    |  #heavy | #closed #hardened |  16¢ |

### Shields

**All shields have the #shield tag.** Shields are added to the _last part_ of your [[Martial Combat#Poise|poise]] calculation.

This means that shields can provide better protection than either a helmet or armor with lower dice, which makes the wearing of armor _less of a necessity_ in certain contexts.

Be aware, though, that some weapons and magics can bypass your shield entirely, and they do nothing to reduce stamina damage from [[Spur|spur]] attacks.

| Dice | #shield           |  Weight | Additional Tags                | ₡ost |
| ---- | :---------------- | :-----: | ------------------------------ | ---: |
| +1   | **Small Shield**  |  #light | #worn                          |   6¢ |
| +1   | **Buckler**       |  #light | #short #bashing #brawler       |  10¢ |
| +2   | **Heater**        |  #light | #worn                          |   9¢ |
| +2   | **Round Shield**  | #medium | —                              |   6¢ |
| +2   | **Spiked Shield** |  #heavy | #worn #short #bashing #warrior |  18¢ |
| +3   | **Kite Shield**   | #medium | —                              |   8¢ |
| +3   | **Tower Shield**  |  #heavy | #great                         |  12¢ |

#important Only take the highest dice from your shields to add to your poise. (If you have a weapon with a #hand-guard, for example, but are also using a shield then use the shield's dice for your poise until your shield is [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] or [[Disarm|disarmed]]).

![[Shields Shall be Shattered]]

### Natural Armor

Unarmored or #natural armors have no cost or weight because they are innate to your species. All natural armor also effectively carries the #flexible and #quiet tags, negating the mobility and stealth penalties from normal #armor.

| Dice | #natural                                  |   Type  | Additional Tags                                           |
| ---- | :---------------------------------------- | :-----: | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| +1   | **Unarmored Skin**                        |  #armor | —                                                         |
| +2   | **Tough Hide**                            |  #armor | #secret                                                   |
| +2   | **Fur Coat / Blubber**                    |  #armor | #warming                                                  |
| +3   | **Sharkskin / Scales**                    |  #armor | —                                                         |
| +4   | **Carapace / Shell / Cephalothorax**      |  #armor | #hardened #secret                                         |
| +4   | **Dermal Plates / Scutes / Thick Scales** |  #armor | #cooling                                                  |
| +5   | **Exoskeleton / Scintillating Scales**    |  #armor | #hardened                                                 |
| +1   | **Antlers**                               |  #helm  | #ablative  #binding #brawler #monster                     |
| +1   | **Crest / Rostrum**                       |  #helm  | #crested                                                  |
| +2   | **Horns / Cranial Plates**                |  #helm  | #crested #bashing #brawler #monster                       |
| +3   | **Extremely Thick Skull**                 |  #helm  | #bashing #brawler #monster                                |
| +1   | **Giant Pincer**                          | #shield | #brawler #crushing #great #heavy #monster #rending #short |

Natural armor dice ratings are equivalent to those of [[#Armor|crafted armors]], assuming that the creature is of modest or ample [[Circumstances#Size|size]]. That is, smaller creatures may have fewer dice for the same type of armor, and larger creatures may have more.

> ### Eg.
> A real life sea crab does not have +5 armor — equivalent to platemail — but a giant enemy crab _might!_

You _can_ wear crafted armor over the top of natural armor, but the only reason for doing so would be to reduce the amount of stamina damage you take from [[Spur|spur]] attacks, as per the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]], or to get more dice than your natural armor provides.

#important **Only take the highest armor and helm dice among all the armor your wearing to calculate [[Martial Combat#Poise|poise]]**, do not add them all together.
