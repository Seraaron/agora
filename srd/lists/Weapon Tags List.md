###### Weapon Tags

---

##### #ammo-type

The damage type of this weapon depends on what type of ammo you load into it:

![[Ammo Types]]

---

##### #any-melee

You can use any melee job to attack with this weapon, as though it had all three melee job tags: #brawler #martialist #warrior

---

##### #any-ranged

You can use any ranged job to attack with this weapon, as though it had all three ranged job tags: #archer #hunter #gunner

---

##### #archer

Use with the [[Archer]] job to make ranged attack rolls with this weapon.

---

##### #artillery

Add a +1D bonus to all attacks made with this weapon while it is mounted on a turret, but attacks made with it if it's dismounted cannot benefit from being #light or #heavy.

---

##### #balanced

Counts as #light weapon when used one-handed, or a #heavy weapon when used two-handed — and swapping between grips is a free action — but the weapon is also neither #long nor #short, so it cannot benefit from your positioning.

Balanced items also weighs 2 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].

#imp A weapon must be either #heavy or #light — and either #long or #short — or else it is #balanced.

---

##### #bashing

This weapon inflicts wound with blunt force trauma that can break bones or cause internal bleeding. See [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] for [[Spur]] damage.

---

##### #bayonet

You may treat this item as a #piercing #brawler weapon when the bayonet is attached, but it also adds a +1 difficulty factor to your ranged attacks. The bayonet can also be used separately as a common-quality dagger.

---

##### #binding

Grants a +1D bonus to [[Grapple]] and [[Disarm]] attack rolls, but deals minimal damage on [[Spur]] attacks (see the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]]).

---

##### #brawler

Use with the [[Brawler]] job to make melee attack rolls with this weapon.

---

##### #burning

Deals 7 stamina damage on hit, regardless of what armor the target has (unless they are immune to burning).

---

##### #cavalry

Add a +1D bonus to all attacks made with this weapon while you are mounted, but attacks made with it on foot cannot benefit from being #light or #heavy.

---

##### #crushing

Deals 6 stamina damage on [[Spur]] hit, regardless of the armor the target has (unless they are immune to crushing).

---

##### #explosive

The ammunition for this weapon causes an explosion on impact which deals stamina damage to everyone within close-quarters of your target equal to your margin of success on the attack.

---

##### #firearm

Ignores poise added by a #shield, #hand-guard, or #barding, but makes a loud noise when used — which might draw unwanted attention to the fight, _making stealth impossible_ — and can be deafening if used indoors.

You can also [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shatter a shield]] and still [[Kill]] (pacify) your target with this weapon, unless their shield is  #bullet-proof.

Firearms also tend to be more expensive, due to their abundance of extra tags.

---

##### #flexible

Ignores poise added by shields or hand-guards, but any allies within your close-quarters suffer a +1 difficulty penalty to their attack rolls.

---

##### #formation

Grants +1D to all [[Spur]] and [[Flank]] attack rolls, so long as you remain in close-quarters with an ally also using a #formation weapon.

---

##### #freezing

Deals 5 stamina damage on [[Spur]] hit, regardless of what armor the target has (unless they are immune to freezing).

---

##### #great

Adds a +1D bonus to all [[Spur]] and [[Pacify]] attack rolls when used in battle.

This tag also adds one (+1) to the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]].

You can also [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shatter a shield]] and still [[Kill]] (pacify) your target with this weapon, unless their shield is also #great.

---

##### #gunner

Use with the [[Gunner]] job to make ranged attack rolls with this weapon.

---

##### #hand-guard

This weapon grant +1 poise while equipped, effectively counting as a small #shield, due to its cross-guard, knuckle-bow, or basket-hilt, but that also makes the item more expensive than one without.

---

##### #heavy

Add a +1D bonus to [[Assault]] and [[Pacify]] attack rolls, and must be wielded with two hands (for modest or ample sized creatures).

Heavy items also weigh 3 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].

---

##### #hunter

Use with the [[Hunter]] job to make ranged attack rolls with this weapon.

---

##### #light

Add a +1D bonus to [[Spur]] and [[Flank]] attack rolls, and can be wielded with only one hand (for modest or ample sized creatures).

Light items also weigh 1 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].

---

##### #lightning

Deals 8 stamina damage on hit, regardless of what armor the target has (unless they are immune to lightning).

---

##### #long

Depends on whether the weapon is melee or ranged:

-   (_melee_): Adds a +1D bonus against targets in open spaces.
-   (_ranged_): Adds a +1D bonus against 'far away' targets.

---

##### #martialist

Use with the [[Martialist]] job to make melee attack rolls with this weapon.

---

##### #natural

This “item” is a part of your body and cannot be disarmed (though it could be dismembered, which would count as a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]]). It is innate to your species.

It doesn't weigh anything, but it cannot be bought or sold.

---

##### #paired

Usually come as a pair of symmetrical weapons; one for each hand. You gain a +1D bonus to your [[Spur]] and [[Assault]] rolls but _only if_ you have both weapons equipped and have the 'Ambidexterity' specialty.

---

##### #piercing

This weapon inflicts wounds with penerating trauma that causes major blood loss. See [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] for [[Spur]] damage.

---

##### #reload

You must spend a turn resetting or reloading this weapon between every attack, using the [[Interact]] move.

---

##### #rending

This weapon inflict wounds by tearing flesh, causing deep lacerations, and dislocating joints. See [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] for [[Spur]] damage.

---

##### #scope

When you make attacks with this weapon from the 'remote' distance you may ignore the usual poise bonus your target would gain (from 'shooting into the fray') and effectively placing you outside of a battle when used to snipe at targets this way.

---

##### #secret

Can be easily hidden on your person and quickly drawn from that hiding place as a free action with a Finesse check, but it slips from your hand if the roll fails.

This tag also subtracts one (-1) from the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]], to a minimum of 0.

---

##### #short

Depends on whether the weapon is melee or ranged:

-   (_melee_): Adds a +1D bonus against targets in enclosed spaces.
-   (_ranged_): Adds a +1D bonus against 'nearby' targets.

---

##### #one-shot

This weapon can only be used with a ranged attack once per battle, either because re-loading it takes too long, or because it is thrown and would have to be retrieved to be used again.

---

##### #slashing

This weapon inflicts wounds with deep cuts and slices that cause major blood loss. See [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] for [[Spur]] damage.

---

##### #returning

There is a 1-in-6 chance that this weapon returns to you after it's thrown. (This increases to a 50:50 chance with the 'Boomeranger' specialty).

---

##### #two-shot

This weapon can only be used with a ranged attack twice per battle, either because re-loading it takes too long, or because it is common to only carry two and then retrieve them after the battle.

---

##### #warrior

Use with the [[Warrior]] job to make melee attack rolls with this weapon.

---

##### #worn

This item cannot be disarmed or pick-pocketed while equipped, but it takes a turn to drop — using [[Interact]], instead of a free action — and _two turns_ to equip.

You can only wear one item of the same type at a time, unless it is also #paired.

---

##### #x-shot

This weapon can only be used with a ranged attack 'x' times per battle, either because re-loading it takes too long, or because it is common to only that many of them and then retrieve them after the battle.
