###### Caps Menu

##### Jobs: 15 ¢

- _Each new job level costs 15 caps._
- **Use the [[Jobs List]] to choose your [[Jobs|jobs]].**

❗ Six is the maximum job level you can buy up to, _with caps_, during character creation. You cannot buy '[[Jobs#Master Levels|master levels]]' with caps.

##### Specialties: [№ Sp.] ¢

- _The cost of each new specialty is equal to the number of specialties you already have_.
- **Use the [[Specialties List]] to choose your [[Specialties|specialties]]**, or make up your own.
- Remember to fill in any ['[[Specialties#Generic Specialties|generics]]'] with your own setting-appropriate information.

##### Assets: [10 × Dc.] ¢

- _[[Assets and Gear#Assets|Asset]] costs are equal to their die rating, multiplied by 10_.
- **Use the [[Asset Examples List|Assets List]] for examples**.
- Most [[Professions List|professions]] and [[Cultures List|cultures]] grant you a free prestige asset or two, but very few will grant capital.

##### Gear: ƒ(tags) ¢

- **[[Assets and Gear#Gear|Gear]] costs are _individually listed_ in the [[Gear List]]**, calculated using a formula based on their tags.
- Most [[Professions List|professions]] give you some gear for free.
- You gain a set of [[Common-Quality]] tools for all _non-martial_ jobs that are **level 3 or higher**, for free, at the end of character creation.

##### Conditions: 8 ¢

- _Each new condition costs 8 caps._
- **Use the [[D666 Conditions]] to to choose your [[Conditions|conditions]]**, or make up your own.
- You can have up to six 'active' conditions, at any one time.

##### Gambit Costs: 12 ¢

- _Buying or upgrading a gambit both cost 12 caps_, but buying a new gambit takes up another [[Gambits#Slots|gambit slot]].
- **Use the [[Gambits List]] to choose your [[Gambits|gambits]]**, if any.
- More powerful gambits don't cost extra, so **it's up to your [[Facilitator|FC]] to disallow the use of certain gambits**, or they may restrict you to only be able to buy gambits of a certain power category: [[Gambits List#Commonplace Gambits|Commonplace]], [[Gambits List#Extraordinary Gambits|Extraordinary]], or [[Gambits List#Supernatural Gambits|Supernatural]].
- You can have up to three 'active' gambits, at any one time.

##### Spell Costs: [5 × Lv.] ¢

- If you're using a system with [[Spellcasting#Spell Levels|spell levels]], then **spells cost 5 times their spell level**, _on average_.
- _Level 0 spells or 'cantrips' cost 3 caps each_.

❓ Your [[Facilitator|FC]] may choose to make certain spells more or less expensive, however, depending on their rarity.
