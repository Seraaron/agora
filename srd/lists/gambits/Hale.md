|   _Effects_ | Constant                                                                                         |
| ----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    _Basic:_ | Your body and mind are simply more robust. You have a maximum of 3 [[Health]] now, instead of 2. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your maximum Health is now raised to 4.                                                          |

**Note:** You'll need to draw in the extra Health boxes on your character sheet to accommodate this gambit. Also _fair warning_, this may seriously break the game, consult your [[Peers]] before taking this gambit.
