### Psychopomp

|   _Effects_ | Instant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|    _Basic:_ | When you perform the proper rituals to bury or cremate another character, or otherwise help them to peacefully pass onto the afterlife, you gain a Lot. If the character was a PC then you regain Ego instead, and that player's next character starts with half of their previous character's Kismet (rounded down) â€” excluding Health. |
| _Advanced:_ | The player's next character begins with _all_ of their previous character's Kismet, _and_ a point of Fidelity if their previous character had none.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Note:** This does not work if you or an ally were also responsible for the character's death.
