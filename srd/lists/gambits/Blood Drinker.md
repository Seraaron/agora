### Blood Drinker

|   _Effects_ | Instant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|    _Basic:_ | You can drink the blood of other sapient beings to reduce your [[Stress]]. It matters not whether it is given freely or unwillingly — though you will probably have to wrestle or bind them first if they _are_ unwilling — but the blood must be fresh. When you do this, all of the stress in a chosen ability is lost and your target gains that stress instead.              |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now drink the blood of other sapient beings to regain [[Health]] too. You regain a point of Health, while your target loses one of theirs. Alternatively, _or additionally_, you can drink a point of Health to count as a successful treatment for your wounds, so that healing can begin. If you drink both points of Health from a target, they will most likely die. |

**Note:** The advanced version of this gambit is very powerful, as it circumvents the normal need to [[Health#Healing|change a Creed to regain Health]].
