### Sword Pocket

|   _Effects_ | Constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|    _Basic:_ | A fold in reality, extra-dimensional hole, or other strange magic allows you stow away a #light or #medium weapon, or similarly-sized object, and keep it completely hidden. This effectively gives it the #secret tag, meaning you can draw it as a free action with a successful Finesse check. It still has the same carry weight cost though, even while stowed. |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now stow a #heavy or #great weapon too, or multiple smaller lighter weapons and objects â€” up to a total carry weight of 4. Additionally, they can be withdrawn from the pocket as a free action without the need for a Check.                                                                                                                                |
