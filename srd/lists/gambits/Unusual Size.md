|    _Basic:_ | You are a natural [[Size]] category smaller or larger than most other adult members of your species, choose which when you take this gambit. _For example_, an adult human is normally 'Modest' size, so you could be 'Small' (~3-5 _ft_) or 'Ample' (~6-7 _ft_).                    |
| _Advanced:_ | You are _two_ natural size categories smaller or larger than most other adult members of your species, choose which when you take this gambit. _For example_, an adult human is normally 'Modest' size, so you could be 'Smaller-than-Small' (~1-3 _ft_) or 'Large' (~7-9 _ft_). |

**Note:** Usually only available during [[Character Assembly]], unless you use permanent magical enhancements, have an unexpected growth spurt, or get kind of augmentation to attain or upgrade this gambit at a later date.
