|    _Basic:_ | You get a shiver down your spine whenever you enter a place of death, and you can hear the whispers of ghosts. You may ask them questions but they might not always answerâ€¦ |
| _Advanced:_ | This gambit gains a 'once per session' use that allows you to see and even physically touch the spirits you normally hear, lasting for the duration of a scene.             |
