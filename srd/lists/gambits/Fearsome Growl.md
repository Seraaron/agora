|   _Effects_ | Instant                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    _Basic:_ | You utter a primal growl, or bear your teeth like a wild animal, and gain a +1 bonus die to an intimidation attempt, or an opponent trying to intimidate you gains a +1 difficulty penalty. |
| _Advanced:_ | An aura of fear raises up around you, and the intimidation attempt now uses naturally [[Exploding Dice]] too, or an opponent trying to intimidate you suffers a -1 die penalty.             |
