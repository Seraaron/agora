### Premeditated Murder

|   _Effects_ | Scene                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    _Basic:_ | While attempting a murder, or killing in cold blood (ie. _not_ during combat), you may add +1 bonus dice to any related rolls â€” sneaking, stabbing, chasing, strangling, etc. |
| _Advanced:_ | In addition to the bonuses on your rolls, your target suffers a +1 difficulty penalty to all of theirs.                                                                       |
