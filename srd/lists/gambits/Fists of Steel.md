|    _Basic:_ | Through training, augmentation, or divine blessings, your hands are as hard as carburized iron. Your punch attacks gain the #bashing damage tag and the #hand-guard tag, raising your Poise against incoming strikes.       |
| _Advanced:_ | Through even greater training and discipline, your fists are hardened even further and gain the #piercing tag too. Additionally, _all_ of your other #natural weapons gain the #bashing tag, if they don't already have it. |
