### FÃ¢e Blooded

|   _Effects_ | Scene                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|    _Basic:_ | You are long-lived, and sometimes seem to operate on a higher plane. When dealing with lowly mortal affairs and innocuous things, add +1 Presence for the entire duration of a social conflict, or add a +1 difficulty factor to any mortal's attempt to convince you of anything. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your rolls to reject or prove a point during the scene each gain a +1 bonus die too.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
