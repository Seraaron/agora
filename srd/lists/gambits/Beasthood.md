#### Beasthood

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Constant_ / _Scene_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|    _Basic:_ | You have animalistic features. The extent of which depends on your parentage, and the strength of the old gods that reside in your blood. Choose any #natural armor and weapons, a new [[Size]], and anything else that would be appropriate to suit your desired _everyday appearance_. Is your heritage noticeable by anyone, or is it only a subtle tell? Are you a member of an identifiable group of similar beings, or a completely unique example of beasthood? |
| _Advanced:_ | This gambit gains a new effect that lasts a scene. When used, you transform into a more potent version of yourself — an animal, some kind of hybrid, or a near-monstrous form — as the beast awakens. You are limited by how often you can do this though, because you will take a random point of [[Stress]] at the end of the scene.  |

**Note:** Discuss with your [[Facilitator|FC]] exactly what kind of powers you gain from this gambit — especially while transformed — as this can be anything from additional weapons or armor, bonus dice to certain rolls, access to another gambit or spell-like effect, or even a temporarily advanced ability rank. Get creative!
