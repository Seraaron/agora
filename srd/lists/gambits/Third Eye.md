|    _Basic:_ | You physically _or metaphorically_ open your mind's eye and see all that it sees â€” piercing your gaze into the spirit realm. You can see magical auras or people's chakras', the flow of life's essence through their bodies. You may gain a +1 bonus die to a relevant perception or identification rolls for the scene.                  |
| _Advanced:_ | You are able to see reality as it truly is. You can see both the living and the dead, from all angles. You can see those who have hidden themselves from sight with magic. You can see the light beyond the stars. You can even sometimes see the spaces between dimensions. Any related perception rolls now also use [[Exploding Dice]]. |

**Note:** _More generally_ using this gambit gives an opportunity to your FC to inform you of things you otherwise wouldn't be able to sense. Especially in relation to identifying different types of magic, aura, or spirit.
