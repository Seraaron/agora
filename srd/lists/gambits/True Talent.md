|    _Basic:_ | Choose a job when you take this gambit. That job now requires 1 fewer exp to level up. Once you fill the exp bar up to 11 while you're at level 6 you'll automatically advance the job to level 7, without the need for a master to train you â€” though this still counts as a master level. |
| _Advanced:_ | Once per campaign arc, you can earn an additional master level in this job without the need for training, so long as the exp bar is full. This can take you up to level 9, at most. (ie. Level 10 would still require a grandmaster mentor).                                                |
