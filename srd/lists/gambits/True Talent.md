### True Talent

|    _Basic:_ | Choose a job when you take this gambit. That job now requires 1 fewer exp to level up. Once you fill the exp bar up to 11 while you're at level 6 you'll automatically advance the job to level 7 (without the need for a master to train you — though this still counts as a master level). |
| _Advanced:_ | Once per campaign arc, you can earn an additional master level in this job without the need for training — so long as the exp bar is full. This can take you up to level 9, at most. (ie. Level 10 would still require a grandmaster mentor).                                                |

**Note:** After reaching level 6 or higher with the chosen job, you may vote to replace this gambit in your next development session or else choose a new _level 1_ job for it to start affecting.
