### Haunted

|   _Effects_ | Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|    _Basic:_ | You are actively possessed or frequently harried by a ghost, dæmon, fâe being, or other spirit. Once per session, for the remainder of that session, you can allow the spirit to partially inhabit you: Swap out one of your Goals, Habits, or Creeds with one of the spirit's choice (or choose randomly). Your reward is doubled if you then earn [[Kismet]] from this principle during the same session, but the spirit also grows stronger each time you indulge it. |
| _Advanced:_ | The spirit will also aid any of your rolls that relate to their lended principle, granting you a +1 bonus die, but this also means the spirit is exponentially more powerful than you first thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Note:** The spirit also counts as a fourth _special_ [[VINPCs|VINPC]], and may be controlled and voiced by you, your FC, or another Peer. Decide who controls them when you take this gambit. Their principles are also written by the controlling player. Spirits tend to have [[Oaths]] which bind them, making this a very attractive and powerful gambit to certain types of players. This can create good grist for roleplaying, but the narrative consequences are otherwise left open for FCs to experiment with.
