### Whirlwind Strike

|   _Effects_ | Instant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|    _Basic:_ | When you make a combat attack, you can swing wildly and potentially hit many targets at once. Your weapon effectively gains the #spread tag, meaning this deals Disposition damage to everyone within close-quarters of your target main equal to your margin of success on the strike. |
| _Advanced:_ | The #spread damage now reaches out to within a few paces of your target, and you can deliberately avoid hitting allies with this damage too.                                                                                                                                            |

**Note:** You may declare the use of this gambit once you've made an attack and counted your successes.
