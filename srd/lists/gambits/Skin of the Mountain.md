#### Skin of the Mountain

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Constant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    _Basic:_ | Your skin is toughed and your muscles are strengthened by years of training, augmentation, or divine blessing. While wearing no armor, you take Disposition damage in combat as though you were wearing #medium armor (without any weight penalty). |
| _Advanced:_ | You're even tougher now, your skin is like polished granite. You only take Disposition damage as though you were wearing #super-heavy armor.                                                                                                        |

**Note:** Your #natural armor dice are unaffected by this gambit, just the damage you take from [[Spur]] attacks.
