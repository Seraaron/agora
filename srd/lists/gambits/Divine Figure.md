#### Divine Figure

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Constant_ / _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|    _Basic:_ | Your physique is always as strong and statuesque, as thin and wiry, or as plump and buxom as you want to it be, regardless of what you eat or how much exercise you get or what your ability ranks are.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| _Advanced:_ | This gambit gains an additional 'once per session' use that allows you to alter your ideal physique and change your body to match it in the blink of an eye. You can even change your [[Size]] by one step in either direction, to become smaller or larger as desired. The new form then lasts until you change it again (but you can't repeatedly grow or shrink by more than one step from your original size). |
