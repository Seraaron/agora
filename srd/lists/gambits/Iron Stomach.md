|    _Basic:_ | You can eat and digest almost any foodstuff and suffer no ill effects (eg. raw meat, rotten food, weird mushrooms, raw vinegar, tree-bark, grass, bone, shell). Simply put, if an animal or beast somewhere in the world can eat it then so can you. No guarantee that it'll taste good, _but at least you won't starve!_ |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now eat and digest just about anything with no ill effects (eg. metal keys, small rocks, sawdust, bits of plastic, liquid mercury). Simply put, if you can it it in your mouth and swallow it, then you can digest it. _Just try not to break your teeth!_                                                        |
