|    _Basic:_ | You always seem to have just the right tools for the job. Regardless of where you are or what else you're carrying, you can use this gambit to 'find' a useful item in and amongst your stuff or simply scavenged from the environment. This item can't be a weapon, but it can serve as a _single-use tool_ for just about any other job â€” avoiding a difficulty penalty. |
| _Advanced:_ | Despite being single-use, the tool is actually [[Excellent-Quality]] and grants a +1 bonus die to the roll it's used on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Note:** The items produced with this gambit cannot be hoarded or sold. They always seem to break or go missing soon as they are used, no matter how careful you are.
