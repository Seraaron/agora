|   _Effects_ | Instant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|    _Basic:_ | When someone swears an Oath in your presence, you can bare witness and bind them to their word. Not only does this get added as a Creed for them, per the usual rules of [[Oaths]], but you will be made instantly aware if they ever break it. |
| _Advanced:_ | Now if someone ever breaks an oath you've bound, they will lose a point of Health and suffer a mental wound in the process.                                                                                                                     |

**Note:** This can also be used on business contracts.
