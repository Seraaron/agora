### Familiar

|   _Effects_ | Constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|    _Basic:_ | An animal companion, fâe touched sprite, elemental being, or mechanical construct always accompanies you and can follow basic commands. They are intelligent, and can communicate with you in some way — but only you will understand them. The familiar must be a smaller size than you. When you take this gambit, choose two [[Specialties]] for them. These specialties can be used like any other, to KISS your rolls or an ally's. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your familiar is fully sapient and capable of speech that even others can understand (though they can still communicate with you exclusively, if you prefer). They may now also grow to be rideable size — if appropriate. They also gain two more specialties to be used at any time.                                                                                                                                                   |

**Note:** The creature also counts as a fourth _special_ [[VINPCs|VINPC]], and may be controlled and voiced by you, your FC, or another Peer. Decide who controls them when you take this gambit. The Familiar can also _die in your stead_, if you are unable or unwilling to spend Health, but it is otherwise unkillable (unless you make a plan that _relies_ on it being unkillable).
