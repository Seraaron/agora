#### Fâe Borne

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Constant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|    _Basic:_ | You are long-lived — perhaps ageless, even — and more likely to die from a mortal blow than from infirmity. When conducting [[Social Conflict]] with mortals, you are always counted as the oldest character in the room (for the purpose of calculating Presence), regardless of your actual [[Age]].                  |
| _Advanced:_ | Choose any _non-magical_ job when you upgrade this gambit. Your extra time alive has enabled you to hone it into a fine art; weaving a touch of magic with the patience of an immortal. You can now opt to use [[Exploding Dice]] with the chosen job, _whenever you like_, but these also count as [[Stressful Rolls]]. |

**Note:** If a roll is already stressful and you want to use the advanced effect of this gambit, then it become _'doubly stressful'_. That is, you take _two_ [[Stress]] on a failed roll instead of one.
