|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Scene_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|    _Basic:_ | Before you sleep, or as part of a ritual, you can ask the Fates for a vision of the future about a certain topic and thus receive an allusion to those events through strange dreams. This can answer simple questions, but nothing in the future is ever definite. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your visions can also show you things that happened in the past â€” which can give you much more definite answers.                                                                                                                                                    |

**Note:** You can activate this gambit yourself, of course, but your FC can also ask to activate it if they specifically want to relay an important message or give you some clues for you to interpret.
