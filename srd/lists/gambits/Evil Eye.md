### Evil Eye

|   _Effects_ | Instant                                                                                                                         |
| ----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    _Basic:_ | You can stare malevolently at someone performing any Task, about to roll dice, and cause them to suffer a +1 difficulty factor. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your eyes flash red, and the target now suffers a -1 die penalty on their roll instead.                                         |
