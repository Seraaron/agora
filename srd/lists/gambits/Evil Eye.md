|     _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                   |

|    _Basic:_ | You can stare malevolently at someone, and the next time they need to roll dice _in the same scene_ they will suffer a +1 difficulty factor. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your eyes flash red, and the target now suffers a âˆ’1 die penalty on their roll instead.                                                      |
