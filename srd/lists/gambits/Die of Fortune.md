#### Die of Fortune

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|    _Basic:_ | When you need something to exist by sheer chance, when scrambling for an _easy out_, or when you're searching desperately and pleading with the Fates to find something immediately useful, roll a d6: On a 6, some minor miracle saves your skin, or you find what you were looking for. On a 2-5, nothing happens. On a 1, you made the situation far worse. |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now also KISS the die of fortune, to re-roll it. Though the new number it lands on must be kept, even if it's worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Note:** This can't replace a normal Check or Task. It should be mainly used to add flavor, or to avert a disaster at the last moment.
