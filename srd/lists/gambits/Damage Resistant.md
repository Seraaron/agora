|    _Basic:_ | Choose a damage type when you take this gambit. The _base_ Disposition damage you take from [[Spur]] attacks of that type is reduced to 0, regardless of what armor you're wearing. (Margin of success on such rolls may still harm you though). |
| _Advanced:_ | You cannot be wounded by attacks of the given type. If a killing blow would hit you and it has the damage type you're immune to then you take a point of Stress instead of losing Health.                                                                     |
