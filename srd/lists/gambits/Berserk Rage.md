#### Berserk Rage

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Scene_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|    _Basic:_ | You start screaming and raving with a fervor for violence. All your melee attacks now use [[Exploding Dice]] for remainder of the combat scene, but these attacks are all also deemed 'stressful' â€” meaning you will suffer [[Stress]] if the attack roll fails.                            |
| _Advanced:_ | Your fury becomes trance-like, there is almost a clarity to the bloody haze for you, and a totem of war seems to rise up in an aura behind you. You may now choose _which_ of your attack rolls benefit from the exploding dice, and which ones you want to keep mundane and _unstressful_. |
