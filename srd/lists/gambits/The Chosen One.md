|    _Basic:_ | When you take this gambit choose a job and a prophecy about your character. The chosen job can be rolled once per session as though it were one rank better. The prophecy must foretell of the liberation of your people, or your ordained rulership, or something else mighty and prosperous. At least one of your [[Principles]] must always be written to relate to the prophecy. If you die before you fulfill your destiny, or break the principle, then the prophecy was false — or you are deemed to have been a fake all along — and your people will continue to suffer, or you will be shunned. |
| _Advanced:_ | The chosen job may always be rolled as though it were one rank better now, not just once per session. The prophesy and your conviction to fulfill it must be even stronger though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Note:** This is a very powerful gambit that can potentially change the [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]] of your whole campaign, and therefore requires [[Peers|Peer]] approval to take.
