|    _Basic:_ | You can just put your head down and barrel towards an enemy in combat with no fear, avoiding the hesitation penalty from a failed [[Charge]] during combat. |
| _Advanced:_ | You now gain a +1 bonus die to all your charge attacks too.                                                                                                 |
