### Hive Mind

|   _Effects_ | Constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|    _Basic:_ | Your Resolve rank cannot be advanced with Fidelity, and instead depends on your proximity to your colony: 6 if you're a continent away or further, 5 if you're a country away, and 4 if you're a city away or closer. Similarly, your Resolve can only be wounded if something attacks your colony. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your hive grows stronger, meaning that it can both reach its influence further and that the influence is better while you're nearby: 6 if you're a planet away or further, 5 if you're a continent away, 4 if you're a country away, 3 if you're a city away, and 2 if you're in the colony itself. |

**Note:** If your hive has multiple colonies then use the influence of the closest one. Though you can't permanently spend a [[Fidelity]] gauge on your Resolve, it can still be _temporarily advanced_ with a single Fidelity point spend.
