#### Eidetic Memory

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|    _Basic:_ | When you see an image or hear something you want to remember, you can mentally 'snapshot' it, and recall it again at a later point in the same session, or the next session â€” to describe it perfectly to another, or to make a note of it. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your memories are longer-lasting and even more vivid, near lifelike. Any 'snapshoted' scene can be returned to inspect for more details, similar to [[Flashbacks]], at any point in the same campaign arc.                                           |

**Note:** This is useful for newer players or players who are bad at [[Taking notes|taking notes]], since it lets you rely more heavy on the FC to remember things for you. In other words, the FC may speak _through your character_ when you want to recall certain information.
