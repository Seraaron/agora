|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|    _Basic:_ | You break from any mundane physical binding or bondage you've been placed under, including being wrestled to the ground. There is no roll, you're free — though you may be caught again — so start running! |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now instantly break out from magical or mental restraints too. Alternatively, if you've been fully imprisoned then a roll to break out will use [[Exploding Dice]].                                 |
