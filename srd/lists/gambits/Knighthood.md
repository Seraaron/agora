|    _Basic:_ | You are a landed noble or a member of an exclusive warrior society. You are assumed to have access to an estate, a full suit of armor, horses and weapons, house servants and retainers, and taxable farmland. You also have a +1D Asset relating to your title, and a _minimum_ of 5 [[Wealth]]. _All for free._ Take whatever you and your [[Peers]] feel is appropriate to match your setting and time period. But you are also sworn to serve another lord or a higher power: You must use the [[Honor]] capability and swear an Oath of loyalty. |
| _Advanced:_ | You are one of the highest members of your hierarchy, _if not the head_. Your title Asset is upgraded to be +3D, at least, and all your other positions are made bigger, better, and more expensive too. Discuss with your [[Peers]] exactly what these upgrades should look like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Note:** You may rename this gambit to 'chevalier', 'samurai', 'kshatriya', 'praetorian', 'ocelotl', 'hoplite', 'maryannu', 'shi', or any other warrior caste name, or make something up for your setting.

**In other words:** This gambit is for formally recognizing a landed title or higher status in a feudal or warring society, and putting it all in a single neat package. _Is this gambit fair?_ No. That's the point.
