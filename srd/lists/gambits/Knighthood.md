|    _Basic:_ | You are a landed noble or a member of an exclusive warrior society. You are assumed to have access to an estate, a full suit of armor, horses and weapons, house servants and retainers, and taxable farmland. You also have a +1 die Asset relating to your title, and a _minimum_ of 6 starting [[Wealth]]. _All for free._ Take whatever you and your [[Peers]] feel is appropriate to match your setting and time period. But you are also sworn to serve a higher lord or power: You must use the [[Honor]] capability and swear an Oath of loyalty. |
| _Advanced:_ | You are one of the highest members of your hierarchy, _if not the head_. Your title Asset is upgraded to be +3 dice, at least, raise your Wealth by a couple of points, and all your other positions are made bigger, better, and more expensive too. Discuss with your [[Peers]] exactly what these upgrades should look like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**Note:** You may rename this gambit to be 'chevalier', 'samurai', 'kshatriya', 'praetorian', 'ocelotl', 'hoplite', 'maryannu', 'shi', or any other warrior caste name, or make something up for your setting. In other words: This gambit is for formally recognizing a landed title or higher status in a feudal or warring society, and putting it all in a single neat package. _Is this gambit fair?_ No. That's the point.
