#### Sharp Mind

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|    _Basic:_ | You are able to pick out details and make connections that most others miss. After a failed perception, investigation, or research related roll, you can count it as a 'failure with a twist', or on a normal success you can treat it as an 'exceptional success'.                                               |
| _Advanced:_ | Your mind is quicker than ever, nothing gets under your nose while you're focused, and you're even able to spot things that would be ordinarily impossible to notice. You can effectively count an automatic success — as though you had rolled a 6 — on any perception, investigation, or research related roll. |

**Note:** This gambit only works when the target difficulty is static. If you're making an opposed roll and your opponent beats you then you still lose the contest.
