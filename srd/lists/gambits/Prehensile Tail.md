### Prehensile Tail

|   _Effects_ | Instant / Constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|    _Basic:_ | Your tail can somewhat function as a 'third hand'. You may add a +1 bonus die to any action that would ostensibly benefit from its aid — climbing, balancing, swimming, reaching, wrestling, etc. — and it can passively hold objects, including sidearms, and can quickly pass them to you as a free action with a Finesse check. |
| _Advanced:_ | Your tail is now a fully effective 'third hand'. This gambit gains an additional 'passive' effect, which allows you to use a one-handed weapon with your tail during combat. This frees up your main hands to wield a two-handed weapon while still benefiting from a shield, for example.                                         |

**Note:** Requires a long and flexible tail (either innately — because of your species — or as a mutation, or as some kind of cybernetic augmentation)
