#### Psychic Armor

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Scene_                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    _Basic:_ | A shimmering veil envelopes your whole body. This veil counts as #natural armor with +3 dice, and lasts until the end of the scene. When you are struck, the veil flashes and vibrates as it dissipates out the excess energy. |
| _Advanced:_ | The armor is upgraded to give +5 dice of defense, instead, and you also count as wearing a +1 die helmet. The veil also becomes imperceivably thin, and emits no noise or light, counting as #secret armor.                    |

**Note:** The Disposition damage you take from [[Spur]] attacks is unaffected by this gambit, because the psychic armor still counts as #natural armor.
