|    _Basic:_ | When an ally within a few paces of you is about to take damage in combat, or from an environmental effect, you may throw yourself in their way and take the hit for them. The attacker must now work out whether they hit you with their rolled successes instead of their original target. |
| _Advanced:_ | You gain an additional +1 Poise during the moment you use this gambit, making you even harder to hit. Additionally, if the attack _would have killed your ally_ and you saved them, then you regain [[Ego]].                                                                                   |

**Note:** You don't have to use a shield when using this gambit, but you'll greatly benefit from one.
