|    _Basic:_ | During a [[Martial Combat]], if you are hit with a successful offensive move, you can immediately roll your own job level — the same job that your opponent just used against you — and riposte as a free action. The successes from this roll are subtracted from your opponent's Disposition _at the end of the round_, regardless of their Poise or armor. |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now use this gambit even against a failed offensive roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
