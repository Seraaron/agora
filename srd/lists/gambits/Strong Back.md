### Strong Back

|   _Effects_ | Constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    _Basic:_ | You're simply stronger and more able to carry stuff, either through training or natural power. Your _base_ [[Carry Weight]] limit doubles from 8 to 16. (This is before subtracting your Endurance and adding a bonus based on your size). |
| _Advanced:_ | Your base carry limit increases by half-again, to 24. Additionally, any time you wish to perform feats of strength you may take a +1 bonus die.                                                                                            |

**Note:** This can stack with a specialty like 'Hauling', which passively adds +4 to your [[Carry Weight#Carry Limit|carry limit]].
