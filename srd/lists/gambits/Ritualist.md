|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|    _Basic:_ | You're a competent and _careful_ magician, priest, or alchemist. You _know_ how much a spell can go wrong. You've seen it happen before! You take extra care to make sure everything is just right. You may double your ritual preparation time to _half the difficulty_ of a spell or incantation you're currently performing (rounded up). |
| _Advanced:_ | After double-checking everything, you can start to triple-check — increasing the ritual time by half-again, to three times the original prep time — but you only gain a +1 bonus die to your roll. _It's not much, but it might just be enough…!_                                                                                                 |

**Note:** The duration is 'instant' because you can only use the gambit once per session, but the ritual still takes as long as it takes.
