#### Piercing Gaze

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|    _Basic:_ | You stare into someone's eyes, deeply and intensely, and can tell whether they are lying to you — or at least whether they are hiding their true intentions from you — and they know that you know too.             |
| _Advanced:_ | Not only is your target incapable of lying, they are also compelled to tell you the truth in answer to a single question. They will know that you've used some kind of 'trick' on them to get them to speak though. |

**Note:** If a Piercing Gaze meets an [[Ironclad Facade]] then they cancel out.
