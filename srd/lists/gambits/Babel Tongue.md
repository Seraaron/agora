### Babel Tongue

|   _Effects_ | Instant (Constant)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|    _Basic:_ | You can easily pick up and start speaking any language native to your species within only a few hours of listening to people speak it. Effectively, this means that you can use this gambit as a different '[language]' specialty every session.           |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now pick up and speak _any_ language, and can produce vocal and non-vocal sounds that your species should not normally be able to produce. Alternatively (as a constant effect): You can just speak and be understood by almost any sapient being. |

**Note:** The power and usefulness of this gambit really depends on how important language is to your game's setting. So discuss it with your [[Facilitator|FC]]
