### High [stress] Tolerance

|   _Effects_ | Constant                                                                                           |
| ----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    _Basic:_ | Choose a [[Stress]] type when you take this gambit: You can now suffer 3 points it, rather than 2. |
| _Advanced:_ | The first point of stress suffered for the chosen type no longer applies a die penalty.            |

**Note:** If you're at 3 or more stress and have to make a Check with that ability then you'll automatically fail. Also, you'll need to draw in the extra stress box on your character sheet to accommodate this gambit.
