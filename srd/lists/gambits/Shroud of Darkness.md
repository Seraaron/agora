### Shroud of Darkness

|   _Effects_ | Round / Constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|    _Basic:_ | All the lights within a few paces of you wink out. An unnatural darkness crushes them down to pinpoints of light with no radiance, even the sun seems to be blotted out under your presence. All attacks that rely on sight made from within the area of effect (approximately 30 _ft_ or 9 _m_) this round will automatically miss, and attacks made from without will suffer a doubled base difficulty penalty. You are made practically invisible, though your passing will still be somewhat obvious unless it's already dark. |
| _Advanced:_ | The shroud now extends out to a nearby range (~ 100 _ft_ or ~ 30 _m_). The gambit also gains a 'passive' effect that causes lights to always dim in your immediate presence, giving you a +1 bonus die to your stealth related rolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Note:** If a Shroud of Darkness meets an [[Aura of Light]] then they cancel out.
