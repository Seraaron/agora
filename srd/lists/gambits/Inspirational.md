|    _Basic:_ | During a conflict, at the beginning of a round or on your turn, you can reduce your own Disposition to bolster your allies'. For each point you lose, an ally gains one. You can reduce your Disposition by any amount unless it would bring you below 1. |
| _Advanced:_ | The ratio for Disposition sharing is doubled. That is, an ally gains 2 Disposition for each 1 you subtract from yourself.                                                                                                                                 |
