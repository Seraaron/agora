#### Natural Camouflage

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Constant_ / _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|    _Basic:_ | Choose a biome type when you take this gambit. Your skin and hair colors have a natural patterning that allows you to easily blend in with that chosen environment. You gain a +1 bonus die to all attempts to hide, hunt, or move stealthily in the chosen biome, or anyone attempting to search for you suffers a +1 difficulty penalty. |
| _Advanced:_ | This gambit gains a 'once per session' use that allows you to actively alter the biome that your camouflage suits â€” including 'none'. Meaning you can have forest camo one session, and urban camo the next, desert camo after that, and so on.                                                                                            |
