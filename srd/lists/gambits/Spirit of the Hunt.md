|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Scene_                                                                                                                                                        |

|    _Basic:_ | While tracking, trapping, or hunting, you gain a +1 bonus die to all related rolls, until your quarry is captured or slain â€” or until it escapes.            |
| _Advanced:_ | The spirits of the hunt follow you, apparating in an aura and blessing your shots. Your hunting and trapping rolls now use naturally [[Exploding Dice]] too. |
