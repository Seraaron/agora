|   _Effects_ | Constant                                                                                                                                                            |

|    _Basic:_ | Either through sheer determination or a genius aptitude, you gain the ability to take one additional master level, not counting against your usual maximum.         |
| _Advanced:_ | You can take _two_ additional master levels. Furthermore, once those master levels have been filled you gain a free +1 Asset pertaining to your skill and prestige. |

**Note:** You must still acquire the [[Jobs#Master Levels|master levels]] through normal means, this gambit just raises your natural limit â€” which is normally imposed by your character's [[Circumstances#Age|age]].
