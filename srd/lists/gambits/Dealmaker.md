#### Dealmaker

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Instant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|    _Basic:_ | You can begin to barter with a merchant or artisan for things they would not normally be willing to buy or sell — so long as it's legal, or doesn't offend their principles — or else they will immediately direct you to someone they know who _would_ be willing. |
| _Advanced:_ | You can now start to bargain with those who would not normally be predisposed to bargaining in the first place — eg. monarchs, stewards, judges, or villains — so long as you can get an audience with them.                                                        |

**Note:** This gambit just makes your target willing to talk and gets them to seriously consider your offer, it doesn't guarantee that a deal will actually be made. You'll probably still need to roll for that.
