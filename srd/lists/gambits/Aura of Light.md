#### Aura of Light

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Round_ / _Constant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|    _Basic:_ | All the lights within a few paces of you flare up. An unnatural brightness dilates them into blazing beacons that make the shadows recess, and even the sun seems more radiant and glorious than normal. Everything in the area of effect (approximately 30 _ft_ or 9 _m_) is lit up as if under full daylight until the end of the round, removing all penalties or benefits that might normally apply for spotting or attacking targets in dim light or even in no light. Furthermore, any attacks that rely on sight made directly against you suffer a +1 difficulty penalty due to blindness. |
| _Advanced:_ | The aura now extends out to a nearby range (~ 100 _ft_ or ~ 30 _m_). The gambit also gains a new 'passive' effect that causes lights that you focus on to brighten up, giving you a +1 bonus die to rolls related to perception and searching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Note:** If an Aura of Light meets a [[Shroud of Darkness]] then they cancel out.
