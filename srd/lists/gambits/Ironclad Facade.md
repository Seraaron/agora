#### Ironclad Facade

|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Scene_                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    _Basic:_ | An attempt to goad, interrogate, torture, or extort you suffers a +1 difficulty factor penalty to all related rolls. Alternatively, you may gain a +1 bonus die while playing games of skill, deception, or chance. |
| _Advanced:_ | You become practically unreadable for the duration. Mundane attempts to break you are impossible, and even magical or technological probes suffer a doubled base difficulty penalty.                                |

**Note:** If an Ironclad Facade meets a [[Piercing Gaze]] then they cancel out.
