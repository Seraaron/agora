|   _Grade_ | Effect Duration: _Constant_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|    _Basic:_ | Choose a season, animal, or elemental phenomenon when you take this gambit. Your physical appearance takes on aspects of that natural power. Choose one magical job currently at level 1 and raise it to level 2, and you may take a free magic school or elemental specialty.           |
| _Advanced:_ | You may alter your #natural weapons and armor in some fashion that suits your chosen aesthetic. Additionally, _all_ magical jobs that were still at level 1 now raise to level 2, and you can eventually take a master level in one of them without the need for training from a master. |

**Note:** Usually only available during [[Character Assembly]], unless you steal the power of a fâe lord or discover your true heritage at a later date — after a traumatic event, for example.
