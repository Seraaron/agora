|    _Basic:_ | Your beastial, magical, or agumented eyes allow you to see out to nearby distances at night (about 100 feet or 30 meters), but you cannot distinguish between colors. Similarly, you can see with dim light what you would normally be able to see in full light, ignoring any relevant penalties. |
| _Advanced:_ | You can see even further at night now, out to far away distances (~300 feet or ~90 meters), and you can faintly distinguish between hues. Similarly, you can now also see with no light what you would normally be able to see in dim light, ignoring any relevant penalties.                      |

**Note:** In normal nightime darkness _without this gambit_ a character can only see out to a within a few paces (that's ~30 feet or ~9 meters). Also this gambit does not work against magical darkness, pitch blackness, or the oppressive umber of deep underground caves.
