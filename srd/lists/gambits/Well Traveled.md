|    _Basic:_ | You have extensive personal experience with the many cultures and traditions of distant lands. You can immediately gain favor with any foreign NPC, even if you don't speak their language, so long as neither of you are already acting hostile to the other.           |
| _Advanced:_ | This gambit gains an additional 'passive' effect, that means any NPC who you've previously used the active effect of this gambit on can now be found again in the future without the need for a [[Links]] check, but you won't still have their favor if you've used it. |
