| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1.  | **[[Aerie]]:** People of academia, who isolate themselves in a place of learning. Erudite and hermetic types. Always seeking answers to life's mysteries.                                                                                  |
|  2.  | **[[Boreal]]:** Isolate people from the sylvan valleys and deep temperate woodlands. Those who found what they were looking for in those ancient forests and never came back. Some even build houses among the trees.                      |
|  3.  | **[[Capital]]:** Aristocratic types, courtiers and nobles. Entrepreneurs and businesspeople. Those taught imperialistic values, who have become rich from exploitation.                                                                    |
|  4.  | **[[Cradle]]:** People from a place where ‘civilization’ began, or is just beginning. A lush river valley, or flood plain, where the climate's reliable, the animals are happy, and the land is fertile and pleasant.                      |
|  5.  | **[[Desert]]:** Nomadic people from the xeric shrubs and sandy dunes. Reliant on animals for meat and water, often traveling with their herds. The desert is unforgiving, and family bonds are strengthened in its heat.                   |
|  6.  | **[[Highland]]:** Agricultural people who track animals across the great moors, and quarry the foothills for ore, coal, and stone. They may poke fun at lowlanders and their ‘strange ways’, but they aren't so different really.          |

|  8.  | **[[Lowland]]:** Agricultural people who provide food for all the towns and cities, and try to spare some for themselves too. They may poke fun at highlanders and their ‘strange ways’, but they aren't so different really.              |
|  9.  | **[[Maritime]]:** People who traverse the ocean, and those born at sea. Traders, stoics, and dock hands. Often as superstitious as they are fastidious.                                                                                    |
|  10. | **[[Mosaic]]:** A wide range of city peoples, all just trying to make a living. People brought together by adversity. A melting pot of cultures.                                                                                           |
|  11. | **[[Mountain]]:** Isolate people who've made homes for themselves among the alpine peaks and rocky slopes. A hardy people, weathered by the same winds that carved the mountains.                                                          |
|  12. | **[[Pillar]]:** People of principle, poets and philosophers especially. Those who live their lives by strict laws, but also those who aren't afraid to ask _‘who wrote the laws’_ and _‘why’_. They uphold the mantle of shared knowledge. |
|  13. | **[[Prairie]]:** People of the steppes and the great plains. Nomads, farmers, and hunters alike, who all use animals to carry them across the grass seas.                                                                                  |
|  14. | **[[Rainforest]]:** People from the rural jungles and tropical woodlands. Hunter-gatherers mainly. Free, proud, and fiercely independent. They would protect the forests they rely on from any who threaten it.                            |
|  15. | **[[Ritual]]:** A sacred people. Those who incorporate their religion into every aspect of daily life. Ascetics, acolytes, and dedicates. Often treated with reverence by outsiders who share the faith.                                   |
|  16. | **[[Savanna]]:** People from the rural brushlands and subtropical dry forests. Hunter-gatherers mainly. A determined, unshakable, people. Able and willing to feed their whole village. Their sense of community is strong.                |
|  17. | **[[Tundra]]:** Nomadic people from the rural polar steppes and icy tundras. Hunter-gatherers mainly, with strong traditions of hospitality. Weary travelers lost in the snow are always kept after as well as family.                     |
|  18. | **[[Tunnel]]:** Isolate people who make their homes in and around caves, lakes, or mines, to find riches and rare materials. Some even build deep inside the mountains, hewing whole cities from the stone.                                |
|  19. | **[[Wall]]:** Feudal townsfolk, militia and serfs especially. Those who live in places frequently threatened by war. Walled in for their own safety.                                                                                      |
|  20. | **[[Woodland]]:** Agricultural people who rely on the woods and swamps for food and crafts, often supplying cities with building materials. Their rustic and sheltered lifestyle is often envied, but rarely pursued.                      |

## Using Cultures & Peoples

Once you've rolled or chosen a culture, you can read about it in more detail below. Each culture grants a **free +1 level to three [[Jobs|jobs]]**, and **a free [[Specialties|specialty]]** from a list of six. (Roll a d6 or choose one). There are also _**additional benefits**_ which include one more free specialty and either a bonus to your starting [[Wealth]] or free [[Assets and Gear|asset dice]] relating to your Community.

❓ When there is a slash / in a listing, choose only one of the available options. When you see specialties in [square brackets], remember that they are [[Specialties#Generic Specialties|generics]] and can be replaced with anything related to the given noun.

### Variations on a Theme

The individual jobs, specialties, and additional benefits offered by each cultural archetype are mostly just suggestions. _Even the names are left generic to be as widely applicable as possible_. **Feel free to alter any of them with your [[Peers]] approval to suit your setting's specific details or a particular character concept:** Remember, at the end of the day, these are all just archetypes — useful tropes — used as a shorthand for something far more complex. _Those complexities can only come out through play_.

❗ Also, don't feel pressured to stereotype everyone from a particular region as members of the same culture. A single city and can have influence over many different peoples and ecosystems.

> ### Eg.
>
> The politicians of an important coastal city may use [[Capital|Capital Culture]]; but if the city has a prominent university then its students may have [[Pillar]] or [[Aerie|Aerie Culture]] instead; its army and police may use [[Wall|Wall Culture]], while the average citizen may share a [[Mosaic|Mosaic Culture]] or be included as [[Cradle|Cradle People]]; members of the local temple may use [[Ritual|Ritual Culture]], and the farmers and workers may all be [[Lowland|Lowland People]], [[Woodland|Woodsmen]], or off-shore [[Island|Islanders]]; and any travelers, merchants, or visitors from afar could have just about any other culture (or have the same culture, but still come from different places).
