#### Random Cultures

During [[Character Assembly|character assembly]] — or while making an [[Non-player Characters*|NPC]] — roll a twenty-sided die or choose one of the following cultural archetypes:

Once you've rolled or chosen a cultural archetype, you can read about it in more detail [[#The Cultures List|below]].

###### Internal Diversity

The individual jobs, specialities, and additional benefits offered by each cultural archetype are mostly just suggestions. _Even the names are left generic to be as widely applicable as possible_.

**Feel free to alter any of their names or benefits, with your [[Peers]] approval, to suit your setting's specific details or a particular character concept.** Remember, at the end of the day, these are all just _[[Circumstances#Archetypes|archetypes]]_ — useful tropes — used as a shorthand for something far more complex. _Those complexities can only come out through play_.

If you're doing some collaborative [[Worldbuilding*|worldbuilding]], then you may also wish to roll a few default cultures for [[Non-player Characters*|NPCs]] to take on, or if you're using an established setting then matching up the archetypes to some places in your world can be a productive exercise. 

❗ Also, don't feel pressured to stereotype everyone from a particular region as members of the same culture. A single city and can have influence over many different peoples and ecosystems, for example.

> ### Eg.
>
> The politicians of an important coastal city may use [[Imperial|Imperial]] or [[Pillar|Pillar Culture]]; but if the city has a prominent university then its students may have [[Aerie|Aerie Culture]] instead; its army and police may use [[Wall|Wall Culture]], while the average citizen may share a [[Mosaic|Mosaic Culture]] or be included as [[Cradle|Cradle People]]; members of the local temple may use [[Ritual|Ritual Culture]], and the farmers and workers may all be [[Lowland|Lowland People]], [[Woodland|Woodsmen]], or off-shore [[Island|Islanders]]; and any travelers, merchants, or visitors from afar could have just about any other culture (or may share the same geographic cultural archetype, but still come from different physical places).
