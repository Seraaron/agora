##### Ambidexterity
**Use when:** Needing to operate something with both hands equally skillfully, such as when dual-wielding weapons, or playing the piano.
_Passively:_ Lets you ignore any penalties that might otherwise apply from using an 'off-hand', since you don't have one.

##### Kip-Up
You can rise from prone as a *free action* on your turn with a **rising handspring** or a **spinning star kick**.
