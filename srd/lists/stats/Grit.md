### Grit

Grit is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that represents your aptitude and energy for doing violence. It partly-accounts for your _morale_, and partly-accounts for your _morals_.

Use Grit in games about facing the horrors of combat and war, adventures with frequent skirmishes or duels, or games where the characters have to kill others to survive (for whatever reason). If you want to present a grim or callous setting, but still keep a glimmer of humanity to everyone's actions, then use Grit.

A high Grit rank means that you don't hesitate when faced with dire situations, and you're more capable of making tough decisions quickly, not letting the ethical quandaries of your actions stand in your way. Lower Grit means that you either have some misgivings about what you're doing, or just that you're still green.

#imp Most people are not trained killers, so most Grit ranks will be low.

#### Rolling Grit

**Whenever you are about to kill another sapient being** _who is at your mercy_, using any weapon, make a Grit [[Checks|check]]:

This Check is **hard** if you know the target personally, otherwise it is **normal**. Failing means you can't bring yourself to do it, or that you deliberately miss. _There are no easy Grit checks_. 

> #nb
> Your [[Facilitator|FC]] may also ask for you to make a Grit check under some of the following situations:
>
> ###### Hard
>
> -   When you witness proper violence for the first time.
> -   When you are suddenly injured, or your morale is waning.
> -   If you are ever bombarded with artillery or powerful magics, and must take cover for hours at a time.
>
> ###### Normal
>
> -   Every time you witness a murder, or an equally horrific act, or serious gore.
> -   Before you participate in a pitched battle or other coordinated military operation.
> -   When you have some other type of close encounter with death.

Failing a normal Grit check means that you [[Capabilities#What does hesitation mean to you|hesitate]] for a moment, and if the check was hard then you suffer some kind of mental or physical break and gain a random point of [[Stress|stress]].

#que Roll a d6 to choose a random [[Stress#The Core Stresses|core stress]].
