### Grit

Grit is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that represents your aptitude and energy for doing violence. It partly-accounts for your _morale_, and partly-accounts for your _morals_.

Use Grit in games about facing the horrors of combat and war, adventures with frequent [[Martial Conflict|skirmishes or duels]], or games where the characters have to kill other people to survive (for whatever reason). If you want to present a grim, callous, setting but still keep a glimmer of humanity to everyone's actions, then use Grit.

A high Grit rank means that you don't [[Capabilities#What does 'Hesitation' Mean|hesitate]] when faced with dire situations, and you're more capable of making tough decisions quickly, not letting the ethical quandaries of your actions stand in your way. Lower Grit means that you either have some misgivings about what you're doing, or that you're still green.

❗ Most people are not trained killers, so most Grit ranks will be low.

#### Rolling Grit

**Whenever you are about to kill another sapient being** _who is at your mercy_, using any weapon, make a Grit [[Checks|check]].

| Successes | Result       | _Effect_                                                       |
| :-------: | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **0**   | Tough Failure | _You can't bring yourself to do it, or you deliberately miss._ |
|   **1**   | Partial Pass | _You make a mess of the kill. They take a long time to die._   |
|   **2+**  | Pass         | _They die swiftly._                                            |

In general, failing a Grit checks means that you [[Capabilities#What does 'Hesitation' Mean|hesitate]] for a moment. If the roll is deemed [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]] then you'll suffer some kind of mental or physical break and gain a random point of [[Stress|stress]] too.

❓ If you're not using Grit in your game then any successful #martial job roll will usually kill your target, _if that's your intent_. If you _are_ using Grit, then the job roll will put them at your mercy so you can make the Grit check.

> ##### Other Situations
>
> Your [[Facilitator|FC]] may also ask for you to make a Grit check under some of the following situations, for example:
>
> - When you witness proper violence for the first time.
> - And every time thereafter that you witness a murder, or an equally horrific act, or serious gore.
> - When you are suddenly injured, or your morale is waning.
> - If you are ever bombarded with artillery or powerful magics, and must take cover for hours at a time.
> - Before you participate in a pitched battle or other coordinated military operation.
> - Whenever you have some other type of close encounter with death.
