#### Confusion ([[Wits|Wit]])

Being _confused_ is the [[Stress|stress]] of [[Wits]]. It means you are unable to think quickly or clearly, that your attention span is waning, or that your understanding has slipped. It often accompanies feelings of being lost or dazed, as though you have a mental blindspot. You're more likely to make bad leaps of logic and miscalculations, and your decision making might become more chaotic or reactionary.

##### Remedies for Confusion

**Fatigue must be remedied by talking it out with someone, and bouncing ideas around or venting if needs be, until your thoughts are realigned.** Or, if there's no one around to talk to _who will understand you_, then you must go for a long walk, meditate, or otherwise do something to clear your mind.
