#### _Optional:_ Caps as Coins

[[Agora]] is not a game that's particularly interested in counting individual gold pieces, dollars, or credits. The way that [[Wealth]] works typically sweeps all of those details under the rug.

However, since items in the [[Gear List|gear list]]  are provided with prices listed in '[[character assembly points]]' — or _¢aps_ — one could abstract caps into a meta-currency of sorts and use it to transact for in-game items. These 'in game ¢aps' could then function _a lot_ like gold pieces, dollars, or credits, _in aggregate_.

**Each ¢ap would be worth as much as is needed in your game world's proper currency to complete the transaction.** And you can haggle the price by a couple of ¢aps too, if you like.

> ### Eg.
>
> According to [[Armor List|the armor list]], a suit of full plate armor costs 35¢ during character creation, and according to _[the internet](https://duckduckgo.com/)_ such a suit would cost a few thousand dollars in today's money. So we can surmise that one ¢ap is worth roughly $100 (USD) during this transaction.

> Back in the 14th century that same suit of armor might have cost about 70 shillings — or a few hundred days of wages for an English archer — and so 1¢ would equal approximately 2 shillings in this case.

This alternative / additional use of caps is completely optional, and you'll need to discuss it in your [[Development Sessions|session zero]] — because it will depend a lot on style, setting, and personal preference — but **if you decide to use it, then your Wealth score generates its value in ¢aps per month**, and can no longer be rolled, _except for really big purchases_.

❓ You can acquire more ¢'s via work, trade, theft, and all the other myriad of ways that one can earn money in the real world.

❗ Doing this also makes the [[Gear List#Cash-Money|cash-money]] system redundant. Characters would just be paid in caps, as cash, instead of using gear to represent cash.
