#### Shock ([[Finesse|Fin]])

Being _shaken_ is the [[Stress|stress]] of [[Finesse]]. It is a combination of fear and nerves, awe and terror, especially after a traumatic experience. Despite being emotional in nature, it mostly affects your physical ability to stay coordinated. You might be quite literally shaking, meaning you just can't keep a steady hand; or perhaps it makes you angry and unable to concentrate; or maybe it just makes you feel faint.

##### Remedies for Shock

**Shock must be remedied by indulging your personal vices, or by crying, or both**: _whatever calms your nerves and blows off steam_, basically.

> ### Eg.
> Traditionally, 'vices' includes things like theft, violence, or boasting — the [seven deadly sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins) and all that — but it could just as easily mean substance abuse, regressing to old habits, entering a bout of melancholy, or causing personal sacrilege.
