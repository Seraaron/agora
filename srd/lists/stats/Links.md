### Links

Links is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that represents your background ties, social connections, street cred, and general capacity to put names to faces.

Use Links in games that involve meeting lots of [[Non-player Characters|NPCs]], either because of political intrigue or factionalism, or because the characters are traveling all over the world. If you want to allow the players to _invent and contribute new characters to your world_ on the fly, then use Links.

Links helps you to build up networks allies and enemies all with connections to each other for different reasons. It can be useful to make a relationship chart if Links is being used regularly enough.

#### Rolling Links

In order to use Links, you must first think up a [[Non-player Characters|Non-Player Character]] — and give them a name, if you think it's reasonable that your character would remember it — who will be able and willing to help you out.

**This hypothetical character must share _at least one_ [[Circumstances|circumstance]] with you**, for it to be possible for you to already know them (no matter how tangentially). Once the character is clear in your mind, and your [[Peers]] agree that it's possible you could meet them at this time and place (no matter how unlikely), then make a Links roll.

##### Finding People

_Links rolls are a bit strange._ They blur [[Checks vs. Tasks|the line between Checks and Tasks]]. You first collect 3 dice, as per a [[Checks|Check]], but then you can add bonus dice from your [[Assets and Gear#Assets|assets]], like a [[Tasks|Task]]. The difficulty is built out of factors, like a Task, but there are no side-objectives.

#que You can only receive help on a Links roll if it's reasonable for the helper(s) to also know who you're looking for.

> -   They only share a single circumstance with you.
> -   They're from a different class, caste, nation, or species than you (ie. whatever is most relevant that might divide you).
> -   You must find them urgently, they are already preoccupied, or you will be making an odd request of them.
> -   They have no reason to remember you.
>
> _So the maximum difficulty is 6_.

#imp If you're meeting a new NPC for the first time and trying to _make a good impression_, then use an [[Appeal]] check instead.

##### Success and Failure on Links Rolls

There are 3 possible outcomes of a Links roll:

-   **Fall short of the difficulty** = _Negative disposition._
    -   The person you're looking for does not exist, cannot be found right now, or _is found_ but they don't like you.
    -   (nb. this is the FC's choice, since they have to portray them)
-   **Meet the difficulty** = _Neutral disposition._
    -   The person you're looking for is found, but they don't really remember you, have forgiven a past transgression, or don't have any strong opinions about you either way.
    -   (ie. a clean slate)
-   **Surpass the difficulty** = _Positive disposition._
    -   The person you're looking is found, _and they already like you!_
    -   (ie. you _effectively_ start with their [[VINPCs#Favor|favor]], even though they're not technically a VINPC )

##### Hey, I know you!
Links checks can also be used to say that you _already know_ someone that the FC has just introduced, so long as you share a circumstance, but this counts as a difficulty factor — for urgency — and may count a second one if the FC has already named them and you can't remember it.

#### Deriving Your Links Rank

Links starts at [[Rank|rank]] 6, and advances or regresses by one step (ie. 6 ↔ 5 ↔ 4) according to each of your answers below. Rank 6 is the worst and rank 4 is the best that you can reach with these questions:

|     | Links Questions                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #up | If Appeal is your best mental ability, _then advance your Links_                                                                                                                                         |
| #up | If you're well traveled, or send frequent correspondence abroad as part of your occupation, _then advance your Links_                                                                                    |
| #dw | If Wits is your worst mental ability, _then regress your Links_                                                                                                                                          |
| #dw | If you are currently living in a new place that you've not lived in before (ie. a new city, country, planet, etc, or anyplace foreign to you that you've not set roots into), _then regress your Links_ |

#que [[You can only reach rank 3 Links with a special gambit]], and getting to rank 2 Links or higher is normally impossible.
