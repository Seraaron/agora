### Links

Links is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that represents your background ties, social connections, street cred, and general capacity to put names to faces.

Use Links in games that involve meeting lots of [[Non-player Characters*|NPCs]], either because of political intrigue or [[Factions, Institutions, Organizations*|factionalism]], or because the characters are traveling all over the world. **If you want to allow the players to _invent and contribute new characters to your world_ on the fly, then use Links**.

#### Rolling Links

In order to make a Links roll, you must first think of a [[Non-player Characters*|Non-Player Character]] who is local, or easily reachable, and _capable_ of actually helping you with whatever it is you want from them. Then, **two of the following things must be true:**

- [ ] You can remember — and pronounce — their name.
- [ ] You share a [[Cultures List|culture]], [[Professions List|profession]], or [[Circumstances#Traits|circumstantial trait]] with them. _(Excluding age or size)_.
- [ ] You know them _reasonably well_, they're a former friend or college, or they have some other reason to remember you.

##### Bonuses & Penalties

- You may add bonus dice to this roll from _one_ [[Assets and Gear#Prestige|prestigious asset]], such as: _A personal reputation, faction affiliation, or community connection_.
- You could use an appropriate [[Conditions|condition]] to gain a [[Conditions#Using them to your Benefit|benefit]] here too.
- If you must find them urgently, they are already preoccupied, or you will be making an odd request of them, this roll suffers a −1 die penalty.
- You can only receive [[Helping|help]] on a Links roll if it's reasonable for the helper(s) to also know who you're looking for.

##### Results

Once the character is clear in your mind, and your [[Peers]] agree that it's possible you could meet them at this time and place (no matter how unlikely), then make a Links [[Checks|check]].

Your successes on this roll will determine their general disposition towards you when you meet.

| Successes | Disposition   | _Effect_                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **0**   | Negative      | _The person you're looking for is found, but they don't like you, they want to settle a score with you, or they might attack or betray you._                                            |
|   **1**   | Not Available | _The person you're looking for isn't here right now, you'll have to try again later, or ·you meet one of their relatives instead. Maybe they can still help?_                           |
|   **2**   | Neutral       | _The person you're looking for is found, but they don't really remember you, or don't have any strong opinions about you either way. They'll help, but they'll want a favor in return._ |
|   **3+**  | Positive      | _The person you're looking is found, and they already like you! They'll help you without any expectation of payment or mutual benefit._                                                 |

❗ If you're meeting a new [[Non-player Characters*|NPC]] for the first time and trying to _make a good impression_, then use an [[Appeal]] check instead.

#### Links Questions

Links starts at [[Rank|rank]] 6, and advances or regresses by one step (ie. 6 ↔ 5 ↔ 4 ↔ 3) according to each of your answers below. Rank 6 is the worst and rank 3 is the best that you can reach with these questions:

|     | Links Questions                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  ⬆️ | If you consider yourself to be an extrovert, enjoy talking to strangers, or have made a lot of new friends recently, _then advance your Links by 1_.                                                          |

|  ⬇️ | If [[Wits]] is your worst mental ability, _then regress your Links by 1_.                                                                                                                                     |
|  ⬇️ | If you've had some bad experiences with meeting new people, mostly keep to yourself, or have recently lost a friend, _then regress your Links by 1_.                                                          |
|  ⬇️ | If you are currently living in a new place that you've not lived in before (ie. a new city, country, planet, etc, or anyplace foreign to you that you've not set roots into), _then regress your Links by 1_. |
