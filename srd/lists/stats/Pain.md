#### Pain ([[Swiftness|Swi]])

Being _pained_ is the [[Stress|stress]] of [[Swiftness]]. It's not as bad as getting [[Wounds and Scars|wounded]], but pain can also precede a more serious injury. It comes mainly from physical injuries, less from emotional pain. Physically exerting yourself will make you want to cry out or grit your teeth, and your movements are just not as strong or as quick as they should be â€” making you reluctant to do anything you don't have to.

##### Remedies for Pain

**Pain must be remedied by seeking pharmaceutical assistance** (ie. painkillers or opioids), **getting a massage or some other kind of professional physiotherapy, or just by resting well for several days**. The important part is to get away from the source of the pain, and either give it time to heal or hasten that healing somehow.


##### Overflow

If you have too much Pain, it is most likely to overflow into [[Confusion]] or [[Shock]].
