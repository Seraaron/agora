#### Shame ([[Honor|Hon]])

Being _shamed_ is the [[Stress|stress]] of [[Honor]]. Shame is a pain of the subconscious, first and foremost, it means that you are doubtful that you've done the right thing, that you feel disgraced, ignoble, or unworthy. Some are publicly shamed, if they were caught doing something immoral; others just punish themselves in their own mind.

##### Remedies for Shame

**Shame must be remedied by apologizing, formally or informally, to those whom your shameful actions have offended the most**, *or by accepting your punishment if you explicitly broke the codes of your society*. Whether or not you are forgiven is out of your control, but you feel better for the effort.

‚ùì _If you think you are the only one who knows of your shameful actions_, then you must make an offering to your family spirits, your leige, or the gods, instead.

##### Overflow

If you have too much Shame, it is most likely to overflow into a random mental stress. (**Roll a d6:** 1-2 = [[Worry]], 3-4 = [[Burnout]], 5-6 = [[Confusion]]).
