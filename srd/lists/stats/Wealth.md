### Wealth

Wealth is an abstraction of your character's financial stature and available resources. _It is a number that can grow or shrink over time_.

**Wealth measures your monthly _disposable income and lifestyle costs_ during [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]].** This assumes that you have a paid occupation or some other source of financial stability (eg. an inheritance or pension fund, a private stipend, or social welfare).

So long as your Wealth is 3 then your basic needs — food, shelter, transport, etc. — are _just about_ met, during downtime, _but this leaves you with no free time_. **With higher Wealth scores, you're afforded more spare time to gain [[Earning Experience|exp]] or pursuit personal projects**.

If your Wealth ever hits 1 then you are more-or-less made destitute and you will need to make a [[Beggar]], [[Hunter]], [[Servant]], or [[Worker]] roll during each month of downtime to **avoid taking [[Stress|stress]] from starvation or exposure**. _You will not be able to recover from that stress until your Wealth increases,_ or unless someone is particularly charitable.

❓ **If your game's setting or theme isn't too concerned with money then this stat is fairly ignorable.**

> ##### Wealth Rating Examples:
>
> 1. **A vagrant or vagabond**; a fugitive; a cast away; a so-called ‘untouchable’; or someone else's “property”.
> 2. **Living on the poverty line**; an indentured servant; a lowly serf; a struggling adventurer; or just down on your luck.
> 3. **Living within your means**; free but poor, or caged in comfort; a farmer; a nomad; a starting adventurer.
> 4. **Starting to turn a profit**; an apprentice; a student; a priest; a hustler; a successful adventurer; or a seasonal-soldier.
> 5. **Enough savings for emergencies and special occasions**; a guild-member; a trader; a freeholder; or a mercenary.
> 6. **Full records, insurance, and regular savings**; a master artisan; a residential merchant; a superintendent; or a professional-soldier.
> 7. **An aristocrat living off inheritance, investments, or exploitation**; lesser nobility; a guild-master; a landed lord, mayor,  or baronet; a career politician; or a criminal kingpin.
> 8. **Born to wealth and sworn to fealty**; greater nobility; a viceroy, magistrate, or earl; a chancellor; or robber-baron.
> 9. **A true blue-blood**; sovereign nobility; a prince, princess, or duke; a warlord, despot, or dictator; or the cheif executive of a merchantile empire.
>
> There is technically no upper limit to how much wealth one can acquire, but **9 is a good _soft cap_**.

#### Rolling Wealth

If you ever need to make an important purchase then you can **roll your Wealth rating as though it were a [[Jobs|Job level]]**. This roll is used to generate successes, which represents your purchasing power. Thus, your [[Facilitator|FC]] can set you a target difficulty for the transaction, and if you fail then your Wealth may be reduced by one as the cost eats into your savings.

**The [[Rank|rank]] of such a roll depends on the strength and stability of your economy** and may fluctuate if you're spending abroad:

| Rank | Economy                                                              |
| :--: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   6  | A bankrupt, war-torn, stateless, or sabotaged nation                 |
|   5  | Most independent countries and nations, including pastoral societies |
|   4  | Powerful countries, republics, tax havens, or former empires         |
|   3  | A global empire, united federation, or planned economy               |
|   2  | An interstellar empire or trade confederacy                          |
|   1  | A post-scarcity society                                              |

**The difficulty of a Wealth roll should be determined by what you're trying to buy:**

- **Difficulty 1-3:** [[Common-Quality|Common-quality goods]], food, lodging or rent, shoes and clothes, children's toys, small animals, furniture, pulp books, etc.
- **Difficulty 4-6:** [[Excellent-Quality|Excellent-quality items]], feasts, large quantities of herbs and spices, livestock, medicine, jewelry and fashion pieces, boats, artisan books, etc.
- **Difficulty 7-9:** [[Superior-Quality|Superior-quality products]], festivals, large tracts of land, destrier horses or exotic animals, ships, rare books and original manuscripts, etc.
- **Difficulty 10+:** Bespoke _master-crafted_ items, artifacts, or buildings.

##### Debiting Wealth Rolls

When you fail a Wealth roll it puts more strain your finances than you'd normally be comfortable with, **you still complete the purchase but your Wealth is 'debited' by 1 point.** That is, _your next roll will have one fewer die_. Debit functions in a similar way to [[Stress|stress]].

❓ Any debited dice can be recovered by working to pay off the difference, which works in the same way as any other [[Stress#Remedies for Stress|stress remedy scene]].

❗ Similarly, a _[[Wounds and Scars|wounded]] economy_ may cause a recession by 1 rank.

##### Not for Sale

_Alternatively_, if the roll isn't taxing, then a failed Wealth roll simply means that you couldn't find what you were looking for at the price you wanted, or someone else bought the last one before you.

#### Changing Wealth

You may temporarily increase a Wealth roll with the dice from an appropriate [[Assets and Gear|asset]] — such as your influence and status, if you're pulling on it to get a discount or special treatment — or you can spend any [[Gear List#Cash-Money|cash-money]] you happen to have, as a one-time bonus.

You can take out a loan, as 'credit', to temporarily increase your Wealth, _but if it gets [[#Taxing Wealth Rolls|taxed]] then you may have trouble paying it back_. The consequences of which are something you'll have to work out for yourself, but this can be good grist for roleplaying.

**Wealth can only permanently increase via a [[Peers#Peer Votes|Peer vote]] during a [[Development Sessions|development session]]** if you feel as though you've done enough to warrant a raise, or _it can decrease if your [[Facilitator|FC]] thinks you've over-spent this month_, or if you haven't been able to pay back your loans or taxes.
