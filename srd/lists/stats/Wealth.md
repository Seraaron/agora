#### _Optional:_ Wealth

Wealth is an abstraction of your character's economic stature and available resources. _It is a number that can grow or shrink over time_. Your wealth can also mean your influence and status, but those things are usually better represented with [[Assets and Gear|assets]].

**Wealth measures your monthly _disposable income and lifestyle costs_ during [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]].** This assumes that you have a paid occupation or some other source of financial stability (eg. an inheritance or pension fund, a private stipend, or social welfare).

So long as your Wealth is 1 then your basic needs — food, shelter, transport, etc. — are *just about* met, during downtime, but this leaves you with no free time. With higher Wealth scores, you're afforded more spare time to gain exp or pursuit personal projects.

If your Wealth ever hits 0 then you are made destitute and you will need to make a [[Beggar]], [[Hunter]], or [[Explorer]] roll during each month of downtime to avoid losing a point of [[Health]] to starvation or exposure. _This counts as a [[Stressful Rolls|stressful roll]]_.

#question **If your game's setting or theme isn't too concerned with money then this stat is fairly ignorable.**

> ##### Wealth Rating Examples:
>
> 1.  **A vagrant**; a fugitive; an untouchable; or someone else's "property".
> 2.  **Living on the poverty line**; an indentured servant; a failed adventurer; or just down on your luck.
> 3.  **Living within your means**; free but poor; a farmer; living a nomadic lifestyle; a starting adventurer; or caged in comfort.
> 4.  **Starting to turn a profit**; an apprentice; a student; a hustler; a successful adventurer; or a seasonal-soldier.
> 5.  **Enough savings for emergencies and special occasions**; a guild-member; a trader; a freeholder; or a mercenary.
> 6.  **Full records, insurance, and regular savings**; a master artisan; a residential merchant; or a professional-soldier.
> 7.  **An aristocrat living off inheritance, investments, or exploitation**; a superintendent; a guild-master; a landed knight; or a criminal kingpin.
> 8.  **Born to wealth and sworn to fealty**; lesser nobility; a viceroy, magistrate, or lord; a chancellor; or robber-baron.
> 9.  **A true blue-blood**; greater nobility; practically sovereign; a warlord or dictator; or the cheif executive of a merchantile empire.
>
> There is technically no upper limit to how much wealth one can acquire, but **9 is a good _soft cap_**.

##### Changing Wealth

Wealth can increase or decrease via a [[Peers#Peer Votes|Peer vote]] during a [[Development Sessions|development session]] if you feel as though you've done enough to warrant a raise, or if you're [[Facilitator|FC]] thinks you've over-spent this month.

##### Rolling Wealth

If you ever need to make a _big purchase_ then you can **roll your Wealth rating as though it were a [[Jobs|Job level]]**. This roll is used to generate successes, which represent your purchasing power. Thus, your [[Facilitator|FC]] can set you a target difficulty for the transaction, and if you fail then your Wealth may be reduced by one as the cost eats into your savings.

#question The [[Rank|rank]] of such a roll depends on the strength and stability of your economy — which is **4** for most independent nations — and may fluctuate if you're spending abroad.

##### _caps_

[[Agora]] is not a game that's particularly interested in counting individual gold pieces, dollars, or credits. The way that wealth works typically sweeps all of those details under the rug.

However, since items in the [[Gear List|gear list]]  are provided with prices listed in '[[character assembly points]]' — or _¢aps_ — one could abstract caps into a meta-currency of sorts and use it to transact for in-game items. These 'in game ¢aps' could then function _a lot_ like gold pieces, dollars, or credits, _in aggregate_.

**Each ¢ap would be worth as much as is needed in your game world's proper currency to complete the transaction.** And you can haggle the price by a couple of ¢aps too, if you like.

> ### Eg.
> According to [[Armor List|the armor list]], a suit of full plate armor costs 35¢ during character creation, and according to _[the internet](https://duckduckgo.com/)_ such a suit would cost a few thousand dollars in today's money. So we can surmise that one ¢ap is worth roughly $100 (USD) during this transaction.
>
> Back in the 14th century that same suit of armor might have cost about 70 shillings — or a few hundred days of wages for an English archer — and so 1¢ would equal approximately 2 shillings in this case.

This alternative / additional use of caps is completely optional, and you'll need to discuss it in your [[Development Sessions|session zero]] — because it will depend a lot on style, setting, and personal preference — but **if you decide to use it, then your Wealth score generates that many ¢aps per month**, and you can acquire more ¢ via work, trade, theft, and all the other myriad of ways that one can earn money in the real world.
