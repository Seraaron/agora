### Honor

Honor is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that represents your social standing, or 'face', or your cultural privileges within a class society or caste system.

Use Honor in games that heavily feature aspects of duty and chivalry, be that via feudal codes of conduct, religious vows, social credit, or some other organized system of public respect. (Especially for games that make regular use of [[Oaths]]). If you want to play in a more historically authentic setting that cares about vassalage and etiquette, then use Honor.

Importantly, if you live in an honor-bound society, then **Honor is about the observances you must follow** — and the respect and dignities owed to you for doing so — **as a member of your caste**. That is, _a better rank doesn't necessarily indicate a 'higher caste'_, but may mean that you are a more upstanding member of your caste compared to others.

#### Rolling Honor

You mainly make Honor [[Checks|checks]] to avoid embarrassment after a committing a social faux pas.

| Successes | Result        | _Effect_                                                                                                                 |
| :-------: | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   **0**   | Tough Failure | _You are ridiculed for your failure, and gossip spreads about the mishap. You will probably have to make amends._        |
|   **1**   | Partial Pass  | _You make a misjudgment of the situation, but are able to recover at the last moment. You're let off the hook, for now._ |
|   **2**   | Pass          | _You obey all the proper forms, recite all the right honorifics, and effectively recover your social standing._          |
|   **3+**  | Flying Colors | _You go beyond the call of duty, and deftly deal with the situation. You are a shining beacon of an upstanding citizen._ |

In general, failure creates great opportunities for roleplaying. If the roll is deemed to be [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]] then it will cause you to gain '[[Shame]]' (the [[Stress|stress]] of Honor) on failure as well.

> ##### Other Situations
>
> Your [[Facilitator|FC]] may ask for you to make an Honor check under some of the following situations, for example:
>
> - Making yourself clean and presentable, and properly greeting a superior. (_Stressful_ if their arrival is unexpected).
> - Resisting temptations and [[Habits]] that may lead you to an unvirtuous lifestyle. (_Stressful_ if you have a previous history with that kind of thing).
> - Assessing the Honor of someone else, to determine how much respect to treat them with. (_Stressful_ if you're from a different caste or culture from them).
> - Overcoming a moral qualm, and forcing yourself to do _'the right thing'_, whatever that may be. (_Stressful_ if one of your [[Principles|principles]] adds to the conflict).
> - Sacrificing something dear to you in the name of protecting your honor. (_Stressful_ if protecting the honor of another).

Some of these things would be ordinarily do-able without a Check — if you weren't using Honor in your game — but the system exists to facilitate a certain kind of [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|game theme]]. If something seems like it should be trivial but there's some inner conflict or _doubt_ then roll the dice, and let them make a decision for you.

#### Honor Questions

Honor starts at [[Rank|rank]] 3, and regresses by one step (ie. 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → [[#Dishonored|X]]) according to each of your answers below. Rank 3 is the best that you can get using these questions, and that requires that you are a _very_ upstanding person:

|     | Honor Questions                                                                                                                       |
| :-: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  ⬇️ | If you have had to defend your own honor and failed, or tried to offend someone else's and failed, _then regress your Honor by 1_.    |
|  ⬇️ | If you have acted in an immoral way, or reached beyond the duties of your station, _then regress your Honor by 1_.                    |
|  ⬇️ | If you have disobeyed a direct order from your superior, or broken an Oath, _then regress your Honor by 1_.                           |
|  ⬇️ | If you have continually pursued principles (during play) that don't match the ideals of your society, _then regress your Honor by 1_. |

❗ The last question can only be true if you're _re-deriving_ your Honor rank during a [[Development Sessions|development session]].

❓ You can only reach rank 2 Honor with the '[[Refined Capability]]' gambit.

##### Dishonored

If you fall beyond rank 6, then remove the Honor capability from your sheet entirely and add a new [[Conditions|condition]] to represent your societal punishment (eg. being branded, stripped of certain rights, or even exiled). In the most extreme feudalistic societies, losing all your honor may even result in a death sentence! Avoiding this fate means that you're character will have to _become a fugitive to survive_.

##### Rehonored

**Honor can only be regained when you do something that annuls one of your transgressions in the eyes of your society**, advancing back up by one step (ie. 6 → 5 → 4 → 3) each time. These redemptions should be discussed with your [[Peers]], but should reflect your [[Cultures List|culture's]] values, and can be something to strive for with your [[Principles|principles]].

> ### Eg.
>
> Maybe your setting's culture deems large charitable donations to be a good way to regain honor; or another thinks that going on a pilgrimage is the only way to redeem yourself in the eyes of the gods; or perhaps it's settled with a good old-fashioned duel.
