### Honor

Honor is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that represents your social standing or 'face', or your cultural privileges within a caste or class system.

Use Honor in games that heavily feature aspects of duty and chivalry, be that via feudal codes of conduct, religious vows, social credit, or some other organized system of public respect. If you want to play in a more historically accurate setting that cares about vassalage and etiquette, then use Honor.

Importantly, if you live in an honor-bound society, then Honor is about the observances you must follow — and the respect and dignities owed to you for doing so — as a member of your caste. That is, _a better rank doesn't necessarily indicate a 'higher caste'_, but may mean that you are a more upstanding member of your caste compared to others.

#### Rolling Honor

You mainly make Honor [[Checks|checks]] to avoid embarrassment and social faux pas.

> #eg
> Your [[Facilitator|FC]] may ask for you to make an Honor check under some of the following situations:
>
> -   Making yourself clean and presentable, and properly greeting a superior.
>     -   _Hard_ if the event is unexpected.
> -   Resisting temptations and [[Principles#Habits|habits]] that may lead you to an unvirtuous lifestyle.
>     -   _Hard_ if you have a previous history with that kind of thing.
> -   Assessing the Honor of someone else, to determine how much respect to treat them with.
>     -   _Hard_ if you're from a different caste or culture from them.
> -   Overcoming a moral qualm, and forcing yourself to do 'the right thing', whatever that may be.
>     -   _Hard_ if one of your [[Principles|principles]] adds to the conflict.
> -   Sacrificing something dear to you in the name of protecting your honor.
>     -   _Hard_ if protecting the honor of another.

Some of the things above would ordinarily be do-able without a Check — it's usually better to [[When to roll dice|say 'yes']] than perform an _easy_ Honor check, for example — but if there is ever any inner conflict or _doubt_ then roll the dice, and let the result make a decision for you.

#que The 'Etiquette' specialty can *usually* be used instead of [[Ego]] to auto-pass an Honor check, once per session.

#imp Failure creates great opportunities for roleplaying, but it also may cause you to gain '[[Shame]]' (the [[Stress|stress]] of Honor).

#### Deriving Honor

Honor starts at [[Rank|rank]] 3, and regresses by one step (ie. 3 → 4 → 5 → 6) according to each of your answers below. Rank 3 is the best that you can get using these questions, and that requires that you are a _very_ upstanding person:

|     | Honor Questions                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #dw | If you have had to defend your own honor and failed, or tried to offend someone else's and failed, _then regress your Honor_    |
| #dw | If you have acted in an immoral way, or reached beyond the duties of your station, _then regress your Honor_                    |
| #dw | If you have disobeyed a direct order from your superior, or broken an oath, _then regress your Honor_                           |
| #dw | If you have continually pursued principles (during play) that don't match the ideals of your society, _then regress your Honor_ |

#que [[You can only reach rank 2 Honor with a special gambit]].

If you fall beyond rank 6, then remove the Honor capability from your sheet entirely and add a [[Conditions|condition]] to represent your societal punishment (eg. being branded, stripped of certain rights, or even exiled). In the most extreme feudalistic societies, losing all your honor may result in a death sentence; in which case you're character will have to become a _fugitive to survive_.

Honor can only be regained when you do something that annuls one of your transgressions in the eyes of your society, advancing back up by one step (ie. 6 → 5 → 4 → 3) each time. These redemptions should be discussed with [[Peers]], but should reflect your culture's values, and can be something to strive for with your [[Principles|principles]].

> #eg
> Maybe your setting's culture deems large charitable donations to be a good way to regain honor; or another thinks that going on a pilgrimage is the only way to redeem yourself in the eyes of the gods; or perhaps it's settled with a good old-fashioned duel.
