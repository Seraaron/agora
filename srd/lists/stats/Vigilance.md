### Vigilance

Vigilance is a [[Capabilities|capability]] that represents your alertness to the world of the weird, your abnormal perceptions (if any), and your general stability of mind.

Use Vigilance in games about exploration and mystery, or in games with strong themes terror and survival, especially in settings where supernatural events are common or existentially dreadful. If you want to portray a setting where unknowable forces creep behind the fabric of reality, or where such magic is real and known _but still dangerous_, then use Vigilance.

#### Rolling Vigilance

_If you have some kind of supernatural perceptions_, such as the ability to see spiritual energies, read auras, or use some other kind of 'sixth sense', or if you have a weird preternatural talent, like night-vision or lightning reflexes, then a successful Vigilance [[Checks|check]] is usually what's required to 'activate' it _in the heat of the moment_ (or to be able to rely on it when it really counts).

#que The specific rules for these powers are usually given as [[Features]], in their descriptions, along with what constitutes a _hard_ Check for that power.

Similarly, Vigilance may be used as the basis for a [[magical subsystem]], using its rank to perform Tasks with an appropriate [[Jobs|job]] (eg. the default [[Mage*]] job uses Vigilance as its rank).

> #nb
> Your [[Facilitator|FC]] may also ask for you to make a Vigilance check under some of the following situations:
>
> ###### Hard
>
> -   When you witness _real magic_ for the first time.
> -   When you fail to summon or bind a monster, or an experimental spell goes awry.
> -   After participating in a mass ritual or being inducted into a secret society.
> -   If you ever meet a divine or infernal or truly alien being.
>
> ###### Normal
>
> -   Every time you are party to spiritual activity, encounter monsters, or witness the colors out of space.
> -   When you fail to cast a more ordinary spell, or when a spell is cast upon you.
> -   When you have a religious epiphany or a prophetic nightmare.

Failing a normal Vigilance check means that you [[Capabilities#What does hesitation mean to you|hesitate]] for a moment, and if the check was hard then you suffer a spiritual or psychic break and gain a point of '[[Torpor]]' (the [[Stress|stress]] of Vigilance).

#### Deriving Vigilance

Vigilance starts at [[Rank|rank]] 6, and advances or regresses by one step (ie. 6 ↔ 5 ↔ 4 ↔ 3) according to each of your answers below. Rank 6 is the worst and rank 3 is the best that you can reach with these questions:

| #up | If Resolve is your best mental ability, _then advance your Vigilance_                                                                                    |
| #up | If you have stared death in face, or encountered supernatural forces beyond your ken, _then advance your Vigilance_                                      |
| #up | If your life is full of mysticism and wonder, or you're frequently pushing at the boundaries of what was thought possible, _then advance your Vigilance_ |
| #dw | If Endurance is your worst physical ability, _then regress your Vigilance_                                                                               |
| #dw | If you don't believe in fairy tales or ghost stories*, _then regress your Vigilance_                                                                     |
| #dw | If you've so far lead a very sheltered or arrogant lifestyle, _then regress your Vigilance_                                                              |

#ast Or whatever the next-best equivalent for your setting would be, if fairies &or ghosts are real in your world. (The more generic version of this same question is basically, _"do you believe in the stuff that everyone else thinks is 'just fantasy'?"_).

#imp [[You can only reach rank 2 Vigilance with a special gambit]].
