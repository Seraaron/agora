#### D666 Conditions

**The lists below are all _just suggestions_.** Since they're just words or simple phrases it's quite easy to make up new ones. Some may be more applicable than others, and some may rarely ever come up. _This is fine_ because conditions are optional anyway. You may also notice that some are thematically similar, or may even be synonyms, and this is fine as well — because sometimes picking _the right word_ can be important too.

**To roll a D666:** roll 3d6 and take the one that lands closest to your left as the hundreds digit, the one that lands in the middle as the tens digit, and the one that lands to your right as the unitary digit. _This gives up to 216 possible outcomes._
