#### D666 Conditions

**The lists below are all *just suggestions*.** Since they're just words or simple phrases it's quite easy to make up new ones. Some may be more applicable than others, and some may rarely ever come up. *This is fine* because conditions are optional anyway. You may also notice that some are thematically similar, or may even be synonyms, and this is fine as well — because sometimes picking *the right word* can be important too.

**To roll a D666:** roll 3d6 and take the one that lands closest to your left as the hundreds digit, the one that lands in the middle as the tens digit, and the one that lands to your right as the unitary digit. *This gives up to 216 possible outcomes.*
