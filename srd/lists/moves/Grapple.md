#### Grapple

*Describe the techniques you use as you prove your strength and try to force your opponent to the ground or entrap them.*

|    Roll | Difficulty (see above)                                                     |
| ------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Brawler]]** ∥ **[[Hunter]]** ∥ **[[Martialist]]**                      |
|  **+1** | Your target is already prone?                      |
|  **+1** | Your weapon is #light?                                                     |
|  **+1** | You're physically wrestling the target, or your weapon / ammo is #binding? |
|  **+1** | You have a larger physical size than your opponent? (_melee only_)         |
| **+MD** | + [weapon dice] + [any other bonuses]                                      |

| Result       | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | Your target **must immediately yield, or else you will knock them unconscious or bind them**, _and either way they count as being pacified!_ |
| **Failure:** | You hesitate*, you suffer your **[margin of failure]** as Stamina damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                                           |

#ast Hesitation adds a +1 difficulty factor _to all move rolls_, until shaken off.
