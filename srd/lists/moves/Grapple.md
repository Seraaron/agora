#### Grapple

_Describe the techniques you use as you prove your strength and try to force your opponent to the ground or entrap them._

|    Roll | Difficulty (_see above_)                                                                                                              |
| ------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Brawler]]** ∥ **[[Hunter]]** ∥ **[[Martialist]]**                                                                                 |
|  **+1** | (Melee only): You're physically wrestling your opponent to the ground, and you've thrown yourself prone for extra leverage and power? |
|  **+1** | (Melee only): You have a larger physical size than your opponent?                                                                     |
|  **+1** | Your target is already prone?                                                                                                         |
|  **+1-3** | Your weapon is #great, #heavy, or #binding?                                                                                                               |
| **+MD** | + [weapon dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                                                                                               |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                                 |
| -----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | Your target **must immediately yield, or else you will knock them unconscious or bind them**, _and either way they count as being pacified!_ |
| **Failure:** | You hesitate, you suffer your **[margin of failure]** as Stamina damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you**     |
