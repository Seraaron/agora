# Question

###### #ethical #logical #offense #social #move

_You cross-examine your opponent's claims by questioning a third party, asking them things that you already know the answer to, or by asking your opponent some deliberately difficult-to-answer questions. This is a 'high risk, high reward' technique. The Goal is not for them to answer directly, but rather to get them to stumble._
