# Question

###### Logical Tone

_You cross-examine your opponent's claims by questioning a third party, asking them things that you already know the answer to, or by asking your opponent some deliberately difficult-to-answer questions. This is a 'high risk, high reward' technique. The goal is not for them to answer directly, but rather to get them to stumble._

|  **+1** | You asked a rhetorical question, tried to entrap them in a paradox or contradiction, placed a red herring, or buried your lead?                                                    |
|  **+1** | You have avoided any logical fallacies? (eg. _assumed the conclusion, post hoc argument, equivocation, false analogy, hasty generalization, non sequitur, stacked evidence, etc._) |
