# Treat

###### Defensive Stance

_Conflicts are fraught with panic and danger, and sometimes even the best among us get hurt, either physically or emotionally. Describe how you how you catch your breath_ — stopping to just _think clearly_ for a moment — _before gritting your teeth and plunging back into the fray. If you're treating an ally then tell us how you quickly bind their injuries, or try to reassure them._

| **Required Position:** |   Any  | Close-Quarters |
| ---------------------: | :----: | :------------: |
|            **Target:** | _Self_ |     _Ally_     |

|          Roll | Difficulty = [Target's Total Accumulated Stress]                             |
| ------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _**Either:**_ | **[[Medic]]** (_physical stress_) ∥ **[[Nurse]]** (_mental stress_) |
|        **+1** | There are no violent enemies within a few paces?                            |
|        **+1** | This is your first use of Treat this scene?                |
|        **+1** | (If using on an ally): They're also in Defensive stance?            |
|         **+** | [medical tools dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                          |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                                                         |
| -----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | Target immediately **removes a point of [[Stress]]** (◆ → ◇) in the specified ability (until the end of the conflict), _and_ they take a bonus die to their next move roll |
| **Failure:** | *At the end of the round* target **removes a point of [[Stress]]** in the specified ability (until the end of the conflict)                                                      |

#imp  If you accumulate 12 total stress, or if you are treated more than eleven times in a single conflict, _you will fall unconscious_ and can be easily pacified by an opponent.

#que This is effectively the same as the process of '[[Stress#Pushing Through It|Pushing Through It]]' except with a few bonuses from the adrenaline of the conflict.
