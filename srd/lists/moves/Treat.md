# Treat

###### #defensive #utility #martial #medical #move

_Conflicts are fraught with panic and danger, and sometimes even the best among us get hurt, either physically or emotionally. Describe how you how you catch your breath_ — stopping to just _think clearly_ for a moment — _before gritting your teeth and plunging back into the fray. If you're treating an ally then tell us how you quickly bind their injuries, or try to reassure them._

|                 Target: | _Self_ |     _Ally_     |
| ----------------------: | :----: | :------------: |
|  **Required Position:** |   Any  | Close-Quarters |
| **Difficulty Penalty:** |   +1   |       +0       |

|   Roll | Difficulty = [Target's Total Accumulated Stress] + [Penalty] |
| -----: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|        | **[[Medic]]**                                                |
| **+1** | There are no violent enemies within a few paces?             |
| **+1** | This is your first use of Treat this scene?                  |
| **+1** | (If using on an ally): They're also in Defensive stance?     |
|  **+** | [medical tools dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                 |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | Target immediately **removes a point of [[Stress]]** (◆ → ◇) in the specified ability (until the end of the conflict), may clear all other status effects too, _and_ they take a bonus die to their next move roll |
| **Failure:** | _At the end of the round_ target **removes a point of [[Stress]]** in the specified ability (until the end of the conflict)                                                                                        |

❗  If you accumulate 12 total stress, or if you are treated more than eleven times in a single conflict, _you will fall unconscious_ and can be easily pacified by an opponent.

❓ This is effectively the same as the process of '[[Stress#Pushing Through It|Pushing Through It]]' except using Medic instead of Nurse.
