# Plea

###### Empathetic Tone

_To ask for something in earnest, or to give your answer to a claim made by another. To espouse the truth, as you see it. Whether anyone else believes you is another matter, but it can be self-affirming to proclaim your own beliefs, or it can be reassuring to the person you're defending. Tell us what you say._

|   Roll | Difficulty = [Target's Total Accumulated Stress]                   |
| -----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|        | **[[Diplomat]]** ∥ **[[Orator]]** ∥ **[[Beggar]]**                 |
| **+1** | You are genuinely telling the truth (or the truth as you know it)? |
| **+1** | One of your [[Principles]] directly relates to your plea?          |
|  **+** | [reputation dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                          |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                              |
| -----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | Target immediately **removes a point of mental [[Stress]]** in the specified ability, _and_ they take a bonus die to their next move roll |
| **Failure:** | _At the end of the round_ **remove a point of mental [[Stress]]** in the specified ability                                                |

#que This is somewhat similar to the process of '[[Stress#Pushing Through It|Pushing Through It]]' except it uses different jobs, and it only works on [[Argue|argument-inflicted]] stress.
