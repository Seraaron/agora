# Detract

###### Ethical Tone / Empathetic Tone

_You attempt to undermine your opponent's points and positions and try to discredit them, either by attacking their previous arguments or attacking their character. This can be genuinely critical in nature, or you can simply try to get a rouse out them. Be careful though, this tactic can easily backfire!_

|    Roll | Difficulty = [Target's Presence]                                                                                              |

|  **+1** | Your comments were inappropriate, insulting, or impassioned?                                                                  |
|  **+1** | You have employed an ethical or empathetic fallacy? (eg. _appeal to authority, emotion, dogma, or popularity, ad hominem attacks, moral equivalence, ultimatums, scare tactics, strawmen, slippery slopes, etc._) |
| **+MD** | + [aid / other bonuses]                                                                                                         |

| **Success:** | Inflict Composure damage against your target _at the end of the round_ equal to **[your successes]**   |
| **Failure:** | Immediately raise the debate's Momentum by **[your successes]**, _and_ **your target may exploit you** |
