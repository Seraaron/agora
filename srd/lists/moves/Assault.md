# Assault

###### Aggressive Stance

_These attacks are intended to cause harm, draw blood, and cause panic. They could probably kill too, but you have to take what you can get in the heat of battle: Most attacks simply don't connect properly or do enough damage to drop someone immediately. Thus, even when you hit, try to describe what fluke of fate or minor mercy saves your enemy from this being their final moment._
