#### Kill

*Describe how you push the advantage, find an opening, and strike true! Though only the most skilled combatants can drop an opponent dead in their tracks.*

| Roll    | Difficulty (see above)                                              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Archer]]** ∥ **[[Gunner]]** ∥ **[[Warrior]]**                   |
| **+1**  | Your target is in Aggressive stance, or prone?              |
| **+1**  | Your weapon is #heavy?                                              |
| **+1**  | Your opponent is unhelmeted?                                        |
| **+1**  | You are using your weapon at its best range?                       |
|         | (_ie._ #short: _indoors / nearby_, or #long: _outdoors / far away_) |
| **+MD** | + [weapon / mount dice] + [any other bonuses]                       |

| Result       | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | You inflict a mortal wound onto your target and **they will die at the end of the round***, meaning _they count as being pacified!_ |
| **Failure:** | You hesitate, you suffer your **[margin of failure]** as Stamina damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                                                        |

#ast Your target will only die immediately if you twice-exceed the difficulty, otherwise they may yet have a chance to retaliate just before they die.
