#### Kill

_Describe how you push the advantage, find an opening, and strike true! Though only the most skilled combatants can drop an opponent dead in their tracks._

|    Roll | Difficulty = 1 + [Target's Pois.] − (Mome. − [Target's Disp.])                                                                                         |
| ------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Archer]]** ∥ **[[Gunner]]** ∥ **[[Warrior]]**                                                                |
|  **+1** | Your opponent is in aggressive stance?                                                                   |
|  **+1** | Your opponent is unhelmeted?                                                                                     |
|  **+1** | You are using your weapon at its best range? (_ie._ #short: _indoors / nearby_, or #long: _outdoors / far away_) |
| **+1-2** | Your weapon is #heavy or #great?                                              |
| **+MD** | + [weapon / mount dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                                                                  |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                             |
| ------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | You inflict a mortal wound onto your target and **they will die at the end of the round** (or lose [[Health]] if they're a PC), meaning _they count as being pacified!_      |
| **Double Success:** | Only if you *twice-exceeded* the difficulty with your successes will the target **die immediately**!                                                                                                                                         |
| **Failure:** | **You hesitate**, you suffer your **[margin of failure]** as Disposition damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you** |

#important _Executing a surrendered opponent will require a successful [[Grit]] check_.
