# Reposition

###### Defensive Stance

_It's important to be able to respond to the constantly changing information in a battle, but moving around one can be dangerous if you don't time it just right. Describe where you want to move to, relative to another position in sight, and how you make your tactical retreat or reconsolidation._

| **Position of Nearest Enemy:** | Close-Quarters — Within a Few Paces | Nearby — Remote |
| -----------------------------: | :---------------------------------: | :-------------: |
|               Should you roll? |                _Yes_                |       _No_      |

|   Roll | Difficulty = [№ of Enemies in a Few Paces] + [Armor Weight]                                           |
| ------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        | **[[Acrobat]]** (_on foot_) ∥ **[[Rider]]** ∥ **[[Driver]]** ∥ **[[Pilot]]** (_not on foot_)* |
| **+1** | You have allies already at the new position you want to move to?                              |
|  **+** | [aid / other bonuses]                                                                           |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | Move one range bracket* closer or further away from your target:                                                                                                                |
|              | Close-Quarters ⇆ A Few Paces ⇆ Nearby ⇆ Far Away ↦ Remote                                                                                                                |
| **Failure:** | Move one range bracket closer or further away from your target (_as above_), but take your **[margin of failure]** as Stamina damage against yourself _at the end of the round_ |

#ast You may move _up to two range brackets in one move_ if you are mounted (using Rider or Driver) or you may move _up to three at once_ if you are flying (using Pilot).
