| **Success:** | **You win the argument** against this opponent, and _you have genuinely changed  the opponent's mind about your premise_, such that they join your cause. Though you cannot change their creeds! |
| **Failure:** | **You hesitate**, you lose Disposition equal to your **[margin of failure]**, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                           |
