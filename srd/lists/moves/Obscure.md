# Obscure

###### Logical Tone

_You use every trick in the book to block or avoid any paths of inquisition your opponent might try. This is a 'high risk, high reward' technique, that gets harder the longer the conflict goes on. The goal is to create a haze of uncertainty, such that your detractors start to call everything into question._

|   Roll | Difficulty = [The Current MD] + [Target's Investigator lvl.]                                                                                                                      |

| **Success:** | Your target is immediately **struck speechless**, additionally they count as hesitating*, _and_ you add any **[margin of success]** to your own Composure _at the end of the round_. |
| **Failure:** | **You are struck speechless**, you count as hesitating*, _and_ you take your **[margin of failure]** as Composure damage against yourself _at the end of the round_.                 |

#ast Hesitation adds a +1 difficulty factor _to all move rolls_, until shaken off.
