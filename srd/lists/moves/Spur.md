# Spur

###### Aggressive Stance / Counteractive Stance

_Describe how you try to exhaust and demoralize an opponent, goading them with a combination of quick jabs, half-strikes, and verbal barks; or by taking potshots from a distance, and leaving them feeling exposed. Even when you 'miss', it raises the tension for everyone!_
