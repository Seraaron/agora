###### Defensive Stance

_Conflicts aren't all about exchanging points and blows, sometimes you need to get other stuff done in the middle of a battle or argument. Describe what you need or want to do, and how you're doing it._

|      **Effect:** | Use something, or pick something up, *change out or reload a weapon*, or take and use another piece of equipment, *stand up from prone*, or unbind yourself, speak openly, or do basically anything else aside from fighting... |
| **Alt. Effect:** | You can offer your aid to an ally, granting them a bonus die *and* you count as [[Helping]], which can be used this round (_or carried over into the next round_) and can be applied to any other move roll.                                               |

#ast There's no roll to perform this move by itself, but depending on what you're trying to do there may be an independently associated roll.
