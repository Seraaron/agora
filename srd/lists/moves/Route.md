#### Route

_Route is for breaking formations and forcing a retreat._

| Roll    | Difficulty = **[Target's Poise] + [Target's Skirmisher level]**                                     |
| :------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Hunter]]** âˆ¥ **[[Skirmisher]]**                                                                 |
| **+1**  | You have a smaller physical size than your opponent, or your target is mounted and larger than you? |
| **+1**  | Your weapon is #light?                                                                              |
| **+1**  | Your opponent is in Defensive stance?                                                               |
| **+MD** | + [shield / mount dice] + [any other bonuses]                                                       |

| Result       | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | You inflict a point of [[Confusion]] or [[Worry]] stress on your target and force them to immediately move back one range bracket from you, additionally **they cannot use the [[Pacify]] move on their next turn**, _and_ they count as hesitating* |
| **Failure:** | You hesitate*, you can't use either the [[Pacify]] or the [[Flank]] move again on your next turn, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                                                                                              |

#ast Hesitation adds a +1 difficulty factor _to all move rolls_, until shaken off.
