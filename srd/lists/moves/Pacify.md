# Pacify

###### Aggressive Stance

_There's many ways to 'pacify' someone, and how you do it will depend mainly on how you feel about the cause of this violence in the first place. Choose what your intent will be before using this move. Though there's no point trying to disable your opponents until they're are weak enough to justify the risk._

| **Required Position:** |          Close-by — A Few Paces         |  Nearby  | Far Away |
| ---------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :------: | :------: |
|                Intent: | [[Grapple]] ∥ [[Intimidate]] ∥ [[Kill]] | [[Kill]] | [[Kill]] |

| Difficulty = 1 + [Target's Pois.] − (Momentum − [Target's Stam.])                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #imp This is  the _negative difference_ between current Momentum and your target's Stamina, so **if Momentum is _lower_ than their Stamina then the roll is _harder_** by that much, _but the minimum difficulty is still 1 + [target's poise]_ |

![[Grapple]]

![[Intimidate]]

![[Kill]]

**Note:** If you are within range of a character who has already surrendered, gotten paralyzed, or been knocked unconscious, you may automatically bind them  with [[Grapple]].

#imp _Executing a surrendered or unconscious opponent will require a successful [[Grit]] check_.
