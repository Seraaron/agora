###### Aggressive Stance

_'Pacification' means different things to different people. Regardless, there's no point in trying to disable your opponents until they're are weak enough to justify the risk, and choose what your intent will be before using the move._

| **Required Position:** |          Close-by — A Few Paces         |  Nearby  | Far Away |
| ---------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :------: | :------: |
|                Intent: | [[Grapple]] ∥ [[Intimidate]] ∥ [[Kill]] | [[Kill]] | [[Kill]] |

| Difficulty |  =  | 1 + [Target's Poise] − (Momentum − [Target's Stamina] ) |
| ---------: | :-: | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

**Note:** This is  the _negative difference_ between current Momentum and your target's Stamina, so **if Momentum is _lower_ than their Stamina then the roll is _harder_** by that much, _but the minimum penalty is zero_.

![[Grapple]]

![[Intimidate]]

![[Kill]]

**Note:** If you are within range of a character who has already surrendered or been knocked unconscious, you may use this move to automatically bind them.

#imp But _executing a surrendered or unconscious opponent will require a [[Grit]] check_.
