# Dismiss

###### Ethical Stance

_There are many ways you can 'dismiss' someone, and how you do it depends largely on your [[Social Discourse#Premises|premise]] for the whole argument. Choose what your intent will be before using this move. Though there's no point trying to make your conclusion until your opponents position is weak enough to try. _

| _Premise Intent_ |                      |     |     Job Choice    |     |                  |
| ---------------: | -------------------: | :-: | :---------------: | :-: | :--------------- |
|         _Prove:_ | **[[Investigator]]** |  ∥  |   **[[Pundit]]**  |  ∥  | **[[Steward]]**  |
|        _Reject:_ |       **[[Cipher]]** |  ∥  | **[[Commander]]** |  ∥  | **[[Diplomat]]** |
|      _Persuade:_ |       **[[Beggar]]** |  ∥  |  **[[Charmer]]**  |  ∥  | **[[Orator]]**   |

| Difficulty = 1 + [Target's Pres.] − (Momentum − [Target's Comp.])                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #imp This is  the _negative difference_ between current Momentum and your target's Composure, so **if Momentum is _lower_ than their Composure then the roll is _harder_** by that much, _but the minimum difficulty is still 1 + [target's presence]_ |

|    Roll | Difficulty (_see above_)                                                                                                                          |

|         | **Job Choice** (_see above_)                                                                                                                      |
|  **+1** | You have avoided using any rhetorical fallacies? (ie. _you're not just positing theories, making circular arguments, propping up strawmen, etc._) |
|  **+1** | Target is speechless?                                                                                                                             |
| **+MD** | + [reputation dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                                                                                                       |

|       Result |  _Intent_  | Consequences                                                                                                                                   |
| -----------: | :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|              |   _Prove_  | **You win the argument** and _your opponent cannot ignore or contradict your premise anymore_, though they may not like it                     |
| **Success:** |  _Reject_  | **You win the argument** and _your opponent is forbidden from raising their premise with you again_, or they are rendered powerless to try.    |
|              | _Persuade_ | **You win the argument** and _you have genuinely changed  the opponent's mind about your premise_, such that they join your cause.             |
| **Failure:** |    _Any_   | **You hesitate**, you suffer your **[margin of failure]** as Composure damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you** |

#imp If you are dismissing a character who has no Composure then using this move will automatically succeed.
