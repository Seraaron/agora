#### Prove

_You wish to make the truth known and clear to all. They have different, but incorrect, opinions. You're tying to be honest and you'll make them believe you._

|    Roll | Difficulty = 1 + [Target's Pres.] − (Mome. − [Target's Disp.])                                                                                                                            |
| ------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Investigator]]** ∥ **[[Philosopher]]** ∥ **[[Steward]]**                                                                                                                                 |
|  **+1** | You have **avoided** using any logical fallacies? (eg. _assumed the conclusion, post hoc argument, equivocation, false analogy, hasty generalization, non sequitur, stacked evidence, etc._) |
|  **+1** | Your opponent is using an ethical tone?                                                                                                                                            |
| **+MD** | + [reputation dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                                                                                                                                                  |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                                      |

| **Success:** | **You win the argument** against this opponent, and _your opponent cannot ignore or contradict your premise anymore_, though they may not like it. Though you cannot change their creeds! |
| **Failure:** | **You hesitate**, you lose Disposition equal to your **[margin of failure]**, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                   |
