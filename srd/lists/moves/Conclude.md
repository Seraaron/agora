# Conclude

###### #offense #social #move

_There are many ways you can 'conclude' a discussion, and how you do it depends largely on your [[Social Discourse#Premises|premise]] for the whole argument. Choose what your intent will be before using this move. Though there's no point trying to make your conclusion until your opponents position is weak enough to try. _

|        _Intent_ | Required Tone |
| ---------------:|:-------------:|
| _[[Persuade]]:_ |  #empathetic  |
|   _[[Reject]]:_ |   #ethical    |
|    _[[Prove]]:_ |   #logical    |

**Warning:** The difficulty of this move is governed by the _difference_ between the current Momentum and your target's Disposition, so **if Momentum is _lower_ than their Disposition then the roll is _harder_** by that much.

#question Though _the minimum difficulty is still 1 + [the target's presence]._

![[Persuade]]

![[Reject]]

![[Prove]]

#important If you are concluding against a character who has no Disposition then using this move will automatically succeed.
