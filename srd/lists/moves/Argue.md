# Argue

###### #ethical #offense #social #move

_Tell us how you make your case. What arguments do you put forward, what's your reasoning, can you show your working or bring up any evidence? Lead your listeners through your assumptions. If you're successful, their next talking points will be weakened._

| **Failure:** | Immediately raise the Momentum by your **[margin of failure]**, _and_ **your target may exploit you** |

#important **All [[Stress|stresses]] inflicted by arguments are temporary** and only _lasts until the end the current scene_, and excess argument stress cannot spill over into physical abilities.
