#### Intimidate

_Tell us what you say or do to prove your superiority and get your opponent to concede or flee?_

|     Roll | Difficulty = 1 + [Target's Pois.] − (Mome. − [Target's Disp.])              |
| -------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          | **[[Commander]]**                                                             |
|   **+1** | Your opponent is already hesitating?                                          |
|   **+1** | Your opponent is in counteractive stance?                               |
| **+1-2** | Your weapon is #heavy or #great?                                              |
|  **+MD** | + [number of target's nearby allies who've already been pacified / dismissed] |
|          | + [weapon / reputation dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                          |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | **Your target hesitates** and **must surrender, faint in fear, plead refereefor mercy, or try to flee** on their next turn, _but either way they count as being pacified!_ |
| **Failure:** | **You hesitate**, you suffer your **[margin of failure]** as Disposition damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                           |
