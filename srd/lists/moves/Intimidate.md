#### Intimidate

_Tell us what you say or do to prove your superiority and get your opponent to concede or flee?_

|     Roll | Difficulty (_see above_)                                                      |
| -------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          | **[[Commander]]**                                                             |
|   **+1** | Your opponent is in Defensive stance, or prone?                               |
|   **+1** | Your opponent is already hesitating?                                          |
| **+1-2** | Your weapon is #heavy or #great?                                              |
|  **+MD** | + [number of target's nearby allies who've already been pacified / dismissed] |
|          | + [weapon / reputation dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                          |

|       Result | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** | Your target hesitates and **must immediately concede, surrender, faint in fear, beg for mercy, or try to flee** on their next turn, _but either way they count as being pacified!_ |
| **Failure:** | You hesitate, suffer **[your margin of failure]** as Stamina / Disposition damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                 |
