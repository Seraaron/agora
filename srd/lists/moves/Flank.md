# Flank

###### #offense #martial #move

_These are all 'high risk, high reward' techniques, and should only really be attempted when you're really sure you'll make it, or when you have no other choice but to try something special. There are three options: Charge, Disarm, and Rout._

|      _Intent_ |        Required Stance        | Target's Position  |
| ------------: | :---------------------------: | :----------------- |
| _[[Charge]]:_ | #aggressive or #counteractive | Within a Few Paces |
|   _[[Rout]]:_ |         #counteractive        | Nearby (or closer) |
| _[[Disarm]]:_ |  #counteractive or #defensive | Close-Quarters     |
