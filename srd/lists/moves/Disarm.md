#### Disarm

_Disarm is for skillfully forcing your opponent to drop their weapon, or unseating them from a steed, or knocking them out of a vehicle as they pass you by._

| **Success:** | Your **target's weapon or shield flies out of their hand** and lands _within a few paces_ (or you may _unseat them from their mount_ and they **fall prone**), _and_ you deal any **[margin of success]** as Disposition damage _at the end of the round_ |
| **Failure:** | You take your **[margin of failure]** in Disposition damage _at the end of the round_, and **your target may exploit you**                                                                                                                                |
