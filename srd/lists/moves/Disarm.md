#### Disarm

_Disarm is for skillfully forcing your opponent to drop their weapon, or unseating them from a steed, or knocking them out of a vehicle as they pass you by._

| Roll    | Difficulty = **[Target's Poise] + [Target's Warrior ∥ Rider lvl.]*** |
| :------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Martialist]]** ∥ **[[Skirmisher]]** ∥ **[[Warrior]]**             |
| **+1**  | Your weapon is #binding?                                              |
| **+1**  | Your weapon is #balanced?                                             |
| **+1**  | Your opponent is in Aggressive stance?                                |
| **+MD** | + [weapon dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                                 |

| Result       | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Success:** | Your **target's weapon or shield flies out of their hand** and lands within a few paces, or you may unseat them from their mount and they fall prone, _and_ you deal any **[margin of success]** as Stamina damage _at the end of the round_ |
| **Failure:** | You take your **[margin of failure]** in Stamina damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                                                                                                     |

#ast Use the target's [[Driver]] or [[Pilot]] level if they're riding a vehicle or flying.
