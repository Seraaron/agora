###### Counteractive Stance / Defensive Stance

_The toils of battle can be harsh and withering. As you take a moment to focus, describe what goes through your head and how it inspires you to keep fighting. If you're rallying your allies, then tell us what you say or do to keep their morale high; either with speech or song._

| **Required Position:** |   Any  | Within a Few Paces |
| ---------------------: | :----: | :------------------------------------: |
|                **Target:** | _Self_ |                _Allies_                |

|          Roll | Difficulty = [Number of Standing Enemy Combatants]    |
| ------------: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
|   _**Self:**_ | **[[Guard]]**  ∥ **[[Musician]]**                     |
|        **+1** | You're in Defensive stance?                           |
|        **+1** | No one on your side has been pacified yet?            |
|        **+** | [armor / musical instrument dice]  + [any other bonuses]      |
| _**Allies:**_ | **[[Commander]]** ∥ **[[Musician]]**                  |
|        **+1** | You're in Counteractive stance?                       |
|        **+1** | Your banner or rallying symbol is still visible?      |
|        **+** | [reputation / musical instrument dice]  + [any other bonuses] |

|       Result | *Target* | Consequences                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------:|:--------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** |  _Self_  | Immediately shake off any hesitation, *and* increase your Stamina by **[your successes]** *at the end of the round*                            |
|              | _Allies_ | _All allies within range_ immediately shake off any hesitation, *and* increase their Stamina by **[your successes]** *at the end of the round* |
|              |          |                                                                                                                                                |
| **Failure:** | _Either_ | Increase the target(s) Stamina by **[your successes]** *at the end of the round*, but you **gain a random point of mental stress**                   |
|              |          | ie. **Roll 1d6:** (1-2 = [[Worry]] ∥ 3-4 = [[Burnout]] ∥ 5-6 = [[Confusion]])       |
