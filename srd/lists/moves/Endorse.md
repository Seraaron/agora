# Endorse

###### Empathetic Tone / Logical Tone

_You try to reinforce a previous point or bring forward new evidence that supports your claim. You try to embolden yourself, or give your backing to the plight of ally. Endorsement can buy you time, but it will never win the discourse. What do you say?_

| **Success:** |  _Self_  | The target immediately shakes off any hesitation, _and_ increases their Composure by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_                                                    |
| **Failure:** | _Either_ | Increase the target's Composure by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_, but you **gain a random point of mental stress**  (though it only lasts until the end of the scene) |

#imp A character cannot be endorsed two rounds in a row.
