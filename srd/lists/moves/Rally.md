# Rally

###### #defensive #counteractive #utility #martial #move

_The toils of battle can be harsh and withering. As you take a moment to focus, describe what goes through your head and how it inspires you to keep fighting. If you're rallying your allies, then tell us what you say or do to keep their morale high — either with speech or song._

| **Success:** |  _Self_  | Immediately shake off any hesitation, _and_ increase your Disposition by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_                            |
|              | _Allies_ | _All allies within range_ immediately shake off any hesitation, _and_ increase their Disposition by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_ |
| **Failure:** | _Either_ | Increase the target(s) Disposition by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_, but you **gain a random point of mental stress**             |

❗ A character cannot be rallied two rounds in a row.
