# Rally

###### Defensive Stance / Counteractive Stance

_The toils of battle can be harsh and withering. As you take a moment to focus, describe what goes through your head and how it inspires you to keep fighting. If you're rallying your allies, then tell us what you say or do to keep their morale high; either with speech or song._

| **Required Position:** |   Any  | Within a Few Paces |
| ---------------------: | :----: | :----------------: |
|            **Target:** | _Self_ |      _Allies_      |

|          Roll | Difficulty = 1 + [Twice the Current MD Value]                   |
| ------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   _**Self:**_ | **[[Guard]]**  ∥ **[[Musician]]**                               |
|        **+1** | You're in Defensive stance?                                     |
|        **+1** | No one on your side has been pacified yet?                      |
|         **+** | [armor / musical instrument dice]  + [aid / other bonuses]      |
| _**Allies:**_ | **[[Commander]]** ∥ **[[Musician]]**                            |
|        **+1** | You're in Counteractive stance?                                 |
|        **+1** | Your banner or rallying symbol is still visible?                |
|         **+** | [reputation / musical instrument dice]  + [aid / other bonuses] |

|       Result | _Target_ | Consequences                                                                                                                                   |
| -----------: | :------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success:** |  _Self_  | Immediately shake off any hesitation, _and_ increase your Stamina by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_                            |
|              | _Allies_ | _All allies within range_ immediately shake off any hesitation, _and_ increase their Stamina by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_ |
|              |          |                                                                                                                                                |
| **Failure:** | _Either_ | Increase the target(s) Stamina by **[your successes]** _at the end of the round_, but you **gain a random point of mental stress**             |
