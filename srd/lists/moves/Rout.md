#### Rout

_Rout is for breaking formations and forcing a retreat._

| **Success:** | You inflict a **random point of mental [[Stress]]** on your target and _force them to immediately move back one range bracket_ from you, additionally **they cannot use the [[Pacify]] move on their next turn**, _and_ **they start hesitating** |
| **Failure:** | **You hesitate**, you can't use the [[Pacify]] move on your next turn, and **your target may exploit you**                                                                                                                                        |
