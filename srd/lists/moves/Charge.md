#### Charge

_Charge is for closing distances and knocking down your target._

|    Roll | Difficulty = **[Target's Poise] + [Target's Guard lvl.]**                          |
| ------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | **[[Brawler]]** âˆ¥ **[[Skirmisher]]**                                                |
|  **+1** | Your weapon is #heavy?                                                              |
|  **+1** | Your opponent is in Counteractive stance?                                           |
|  **+1** | You have a larger physical size than your opponent, or a larger size while mounted? |
| **+MD** | + [shield / mount dice] + [aid / other bonuses]                                       |

| Result       | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Success:** | You move into close-quarters with your target and immediately **knock them prone**, additionally they count as hesitating*, _and_ you deal any **[margin of success]** as Stamina damage _at the end of the round_ |
| **Failure:** | You move into close-quarters but you hesitate* and take your **[target's Poise]** in Stamina damage _at the end of the round_, _and_ **your target may exploit you**                                               |

#ast Hesitation adds a +1 difficulty factor _to all move rolls_, until shaken off.
