| **Success:** | You move into close-quarters with your target and immediately **knock them prone**, _and_ you deal any **[margin of success]** as Disposition damage _at the end of the round_ |
| **Failure:** | You move into close-quarters **but you hesitate** and take your **[target's Poise]** in Disposition damage _at the end of the round_, and **your target may exploit you**                                               |

**Note:** You can _Charge_ from nearby if you're mounted, or from far away if you're flying.
