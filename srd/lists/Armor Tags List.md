### Armor Tags

#ablative

- This item can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] like a #shield to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent or a freak accident.
	- The item is destroyed, and you gain a point of stress, but at least you'll still be alive.

#armor

- Add the armor's dice rating to the _first part_ of your poise calculation while worn.
- However, you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor to all rolls related to stealth, or swimming, climbing, and other acrobatics or mobility.
	- These penalties are negated by #quiet and #flexible, respectively.
- All armor also has the #worn tag for free.

#barding

- Add the item's dice to the last part of your poise calculation (instead of a shield) while riding the creature that's wearing the barding.
- Barding may not be shattered like a shield.

#bullet-proof

- Shields with this tag can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent from a #firearm.
- Armor and helmets with this tag add +1 to your poise *at the end of the normal calculation* making offensive moves harder to use against you, which firearms cannot ignore.

#closed

- This helmet encloses your whole face, or covers it with a mask.
- You gain a +1D bonus to [[Intimidate]] (pacify) attempts, but you suffer a +1 penalty to any rolls that test your sense of sight, hearing, or spacial awareness while it's worn.

#cooling

- You gain a +1D bonus to resisting the effects of hot weather, but you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor when resisting the effects of cold weather.

#crested

- This helm or headpiece bears a colorful crest, decorative horns, or a wide brim.
- You gain a +1D bonus to [[Rally]] and [[Intimidate]] (pacify) attempts, but this tag also adds one (+1) to the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]].

#flexible

- You may ignore the normal +1 difficulty penalty for swimming, climbing, and other acrobatics / mobility rolls from #armor because of this tag.

#formation

- Grants +1D to all [[Spur]] and [[Flank]] attack rolls, so long as you remain in close-quarters with an ally also using a #formation weapon.

#great

- Shields with this tag can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent from a #great weapon.
- This tag also adds one (+1) to the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]].

#hardened

- Armor and helmets with this tag add +1 to your poise *at the end of the normal calculation* making offensive moves harder to use against you.
	- Though #firearm weapons will ignore this bonus.

#heavy

- This item weighs 3 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].
- If it's #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

#helm

- Add the helmet's dice rating to the _middle part_ of your poise calculation while worn.
- A helmet makes you harder to be [[Kill|killed]], because *not wearing a helmet* grants your attacker a bonus die.
- All helmets also have the #worn tag for free.

#light

- This item weighs 1 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].
- If it's #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

#medium

- This item weighs 2 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].
- If it's #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

#natural

- This “item” is a part of your body and cannot be disarmed (though it could be dismembered, which would count as a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]]).
	- It is innate to your species.
	- It does not weigh anything, but it cannot be bought or sold.
- All natural armor also counts as #flexible and #quiet, meaning that it incurs no penalties to mobility or stealth.

#quiet

- You may ignore the normal +1 difficulty penalty for stealth rolls from #armor because of this tag.

#secret

- This armor or helmet can pass as clothes, or be worn under normal clothes while still giving you its protection.
- This tag also subtracts one (-1) from the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]], to a minimum of 0.

#shield

- Add the shield's dice to the _last part_ of your poise calculation while equipped.
- You can also shatter this item to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent used against you.
	- The shield is destroyed, and you gain a point of stress, but at least you'll still be alive.
	- **See:** [[Shields Shall be Shattered]]

#question Though this does not work against #great or #firearm or #magic attacks without the #great or #bullet-proof  or #magic tags on your shield, respectively.

#super-heavy 

- This item weighs 4 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].
- If it's #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

#warming

- You gain a +1D bonus to resisting the effects of cold weather, but you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor when resisting the effects of hot weather.

#worn

- This item cannot be disarmed or pick-pocketed while equipped, but it takes a turn to drop — using [[Interact]], instead of a free action — and _two turns_ to equip.
- You can only wear one item of the same type at a time.
