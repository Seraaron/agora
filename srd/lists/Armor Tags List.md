###### Armor Tags

---

##### #ablative

Can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] like a #shield to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent or a freak accident. The item is destroyed, and you gain a point of stress, but at least you'll still be alive.

---

##### #armor

Add the armor's dice rating to the *first part* of your poise calculation while worn. However, you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor to all rolls related to stealth, or swimming, climbing, and other acrobatics or mobility (these penalties are negated by #quiet and #flexible, respectively).

All armor also has the #worn tag for free.

---

##### #balanced

This item weighs 2 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].

If it's also #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

---

##### #barding

Add the item's dice to the last part of your poise calculation (instead of a shield) while riding the creature that's wearing the barding.

---

##### #bullet-proof

A shield with this tag can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent from a #firearm.

Armor and helms with this tag each add a +1 difficulty penalty to all offensive moves used against you with a #firearm.

---

##### #closed

This helmet encloses your whole face, or covers it with a mask. You gain a +1D bonus to [[Intimidate]] (pacify) attempts, but you suffer a +1 penalty to any rolls that test your sense of sight, hearing, or spacial awareness while it is worn.

---

##### #cooling

You gain a +1D bonus to resisting the effects of hot weather, but you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor when resisting the effects of cold weather.

---

##### #crested

This helmet bears a colorful crest, decorative horns, or a wide brim. You gain a +1D bonus to [[Rally]] and [[Intimidation]] (pacify) attempts, but this tag also adds one (+1) to the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]].

---

##### #flexible

You may ignore the normal +1 difficulty penalty for swimming, climbing, and other acrobatics / mobility rolls from #armor because of this tag.

---

##### #formation

Grants +1D to all [[Spur]] and [[Flank]] attack rolls, so long as you remain in close-quarters with an ally also using a #formation weapon.

---

##### #great

This shield can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent from a #great weapon. This tag also adds one (+1) to the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]].

---

##### #hardened

This item add a +1 penalty to all [[Spur]], [[Assault]], and [[Kill]] (pacify) attacks made against you.

---

##### #heavy

This item weighs 3 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]]. If it's also #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

---

##### #helm

Add the helmet's dice rating to the *middle part* of your poise calculation while worn.

All helmets also have the #worn tag for free.

---

##### #light

This item weighs 1 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].

If it's also #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

---

##### #natural

This “item” is a part of your body and cannot be disarmed (though it could be dismembered, which would count as a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]]). It is innate to your species.

It does not weigh anything, but it cannot be bought or sold. All natural armor also counts as #flexible and #quiet, meaning that it incurs no penalties to mobility or stealth.

---

##### #quiet

You may ignore the normal +1 difficulty penalty for stealth rolls from #armor because of this tag.

---

##### #secret

This armor or helmet can pass as clothes, or be worn under normal clothes while still giving you its protection.

This tag also subtracts one (-1) from the item's [[Carry Weight|encumbrance cost]], to a minimum of 0.

---

##### #shield

Add the shield's dice to the *last part* of your poise calculation while equipped.

You can also shatter this item to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent used against you. The shield is destroyed, and you gain a point of stress, but at least you'll still be alive.

#que Though this does not work against #great or #firearm or #magic attacks without the #great or #bullet-proof  or #magic tags on your shield, respectively.

---

##### #super-heavy

This item weighs 4 in [[Carry Weight|carry costs]].

If it's also #armor then look at the [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] to see how it defends against [[Spur]] damage from different damage types.

---

##### #warming

You gain a +1D bonus to resisting the effects of cold weather, but you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor when resisting the effects of hot weather.

---

##### #worn

This item cannot be disarmed or pick-pocketed while equipped, but it takes a turn to drop — using [[Interact]], instead of a free action — and _two turns_ to equip.

You can only wear one item of the same type at a time.
