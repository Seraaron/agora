### Clothier ([[Endurance|End]])

#artistic #civic #craft #laborious 

Working fine material like wool, cotton, hemp, or silk, into yarn and string, by thrashing the fibers, or carding and felting the wool, and then running them through a spindle or wheel to make threads. Then knitting, or using a loom, to work those materials into bolts of cloth, quilts, rugs, or clothing. Also includes dye-making, patterning, weaving, basketry, net or rope-making, and leather-work.

May also include cutting and styling clothes, shoes, hats, and accessories, or any other fashion items, using [[Appeal]].

#imp **Requires:** A workshop, materials, &or #artistic-tools or #craft-tools

_**Suggested Specialties:** Fashion, Gossip, [handicrafts], Knots, Leatherwork [crafts]..._

> #### High Fashion
>
> The clothes you wear can sometimes matter quite a lot, especially in intrigue-focused and political games, or in sessions with a lot of social interaction with aristocratic factions. Wearing the latest fashion may grant bonus dice to certain rolls, similar to any other [[Assets and Gear|assets]], at the discretion of your [[Facilitator|FC]].
>
> Making such items requires a Clothier roll (with [[Appeal]]), where **the base difficulty of the roll is equal to _twice the value of the dice rating_ you wish the item would grant, then +1 for each additional tag, plus any [[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]]**. This takes a number of weeks equal to the final difficulty.
>
> #fashionable clothing then **grants one fewer die each subsequent time it is worn**, until it's die rating is worthless — *equivalent to normal clothes*.

**Note:** If you just want to craft simple armor — such as cloaks, padded leather, or head-wraps — then please refer to the crafting rules under the [[Smith]] job, but use Clothier instead.
