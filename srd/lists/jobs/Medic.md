### Medic ([[Swiftness|Swi]])

#martial #medical

Providing immediate medical assistance to someone. Administering cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), applying pressure, binding wounds, setting joints, relocating bones, and generally being a first-aid responder in an emergency.

May be used to perform [[Medical Treatment|emergency operations]], _at double the base difficulty_ compared to a [[Physician]], but only if no one more qualified is around; or you can staunch the flow of a badly bleeding [[Wounds and Scars|wound]] while waiting for a doctor to arrive, a difficulty 2 roll, which keeps a dying patient alive for another scene.

May be used to temporarily treat [[Stress|stress]] for someone during [[Martial Combat|combat]] — removing it until the end of the conflict — using their total accumulated stress as the difficulty.

May also include firefighting, using [[Endurance]].

¶ **Requires:** #medical-tools  or #craft-tools in a pinch

_**Suggested Specialties:** Hauling, Improvisation, Knots, Surgery, Wound [conditions]..._

> ##### Specific Factors:
>
> - “The patient is severely wounded, or they need an amputation or cautery...?
> - “You're attempting to treat yourself...?
> - “You're in a hazardous environment, lost at sea, or in the middle of a warzone...?
