### Merchant ([[Resolve|Res]])

#civic #financial

Buying and selling, haggling, and vending goods of all sorts. Attracting customers, sourcing new and interesting merchandise, and doing taxes. Includes identifying and appraising the value of assets and artefacts.

When haggling, start with the base price of the item and then make an [[Opposed Tasks|Opposed task]] roll. Winning the roll means you get to buy for a little less or sell for a little more than the market value (according to your margin of success).
