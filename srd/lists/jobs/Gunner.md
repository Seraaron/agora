### Gunner ([[Finesse|Fin]])

#athletic #martial

Shooting and maintaining guns, such as muskets, rifles, shotguns, and pistols. Mainly used during [[Martial Combat|combat]] to make ranged attacks, using your target's poise as the difficulty (but ignoring most shields), and can inflict a final killing blow without a [[Grit]] check. Can also be used for the final shot when [[Hunter|hunting]] big game.

Also includes operating heavier artillery and seige weapons that use heavy munitions, such as catapults, balista, cannons, mortars, turrets, tanks, gunboats, or drones, if they’re appropriate for your setting.

#imp **Requires:** #firearm or #war-machine weapons

_**Suggested Specialties:** Artillery / Gunnery [weapons], Hauling, Tactics, Observation..._

> #### Using Guns
>
> Guns will _ignore non-bullet-proof shields_ during combat, making them very powerful, but earlier models were also much slower to reload. To the point where you likely wouldn't get able to get off more than one or two shots per battle before needing to switch to a sidearm. As firearms technology improves guns start to jam and backfire a lot less, becoming safer and more efficient for the user (and more deadly for their targets).
>
> Outside of combat, a direct hit from a gun can kill someone in seconds — so it's important to always describe non-pacifying hits from guns during combat as near hits or non-vital hits.
> 
> #imp Always talk with your [[Peers]] before including guns in your game as it may be sensitive issue for some players, and they can drastically change the feel and [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]] of your setting.

**Note:** This job is usually replaced with [[Archer]] if playing in a more antiquated setting.
