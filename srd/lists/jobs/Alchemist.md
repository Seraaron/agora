### Alchemist ([[Wits|Wit]])

#academic #craft #magic #medical #ritual

Transmuting one material to another, either with science or magic — or both? — and typically recording your results as part of a hermetic tradition. Understanding the principles of equivalent exchange. Includes knowledge and use of equipment and reagents, and apothecarial and pharmaceutical knowledge too (ie. the making of drugs, potions, and poisons).

May also include soap and candle making, munitions and weapons experimentation, and making new magical discoveries, using [[Resolve]].

#imp **Requires:** #ritual-tools and #academic-tools

_**Suggested Specialties:** Brewing Potions, Chemistry [science], Distilling Poisons, Esoteric [history], Transmutation [magic], Symbolism, Rituals..._

> #### Alchemy Effects
>
> Choose a desired effect to reproduce from the following list — or _interpret and expand on_ the following to create new and unique effects, with your [[Peers|Peers' approval]] — this sets the base difficulty of the roll:
>
> 1. **Essential Distillation:** Ore ↦ Ingot, Seawater ↦ Salt, Latex ↦ Rubber, Sugar ↦ Alcohol, Metal ↦ Poison, Bitumen ↦ Fuel, etc.
>
> 2. **Elemental Entropy:** Stone ⇌ Sand, Wood ⇌ Soil, Ice ⇌ Water, Iron ⇌ Rust, Fire ⇌ Ash, Air ⇌ Vacuum, etc.
>
> 3. **Physical Transportation:** Swap the positions of two objects of roughly equal mass in identical ritual circles anywhere else in the world.
>
> 4. **Chemical Arithmetic:** Water ⇔ _Hydrogen_ + _Oxygen_, Salt ⇔ _Sodium_ + _Chlorine_, Ruby ⇔ _Aluminum_ + _Oxygen_ + _Chromium_, etc.
>
> 5. **Atomic Miracle:** Lead ↯ Gold, Water ↯ Wine, Wood ↯ Steel, Coal ↯ Diamond, etc.
>
> Only _non-living material_ can be directly affected by alchemy.
>
> ##### Specific Factors:
>
> Decide how much stuff you want to affect in the process, according to the total mass, and increase the difficulty by that much:

> ##### Time and Circles
>
> The alchemy itself occurs _almost instantaneously_ once the Alchemist is ready to perform their work, but **drawing the appropriate ritual circles takes many hours:** _Equal to the difficulty of the tasks they were designed for_. The circles must also completely surround or enclose the target. However, you may draw ritual circles well in advance of needing to use them, and they may be re-used so long as nothing disrupts them.

**Note:** This job is usually replaced with [[Physician*]] if playing in a more contemporary setting.
