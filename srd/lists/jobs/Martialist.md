### Martialist ([[Swiftness|Swi]])

#academic #athletic #martial #performance

Fighting with martial arts weapons and bare fists, kicks, trips and throws, or any other systematic techniques, often while lightly armored. Also includes ceremonial martial performances or choreographed stunts, combat dancing, and sport fighting.

May be used during [[Martial Combat|combat]] to make melee attacks, using the target's  poise as the base difficulty, and can be used to throw targets to the ground or to disarm them.

Martial arts may be culturally specific, so this job will mean different things to different people. Some martial arts use weapons, others use _the body as a weapon_. You may [[Peers|decide as a group]] how a Martialist differs from a [[Warrior]] or a [[Brawler]], in your setting, for example, aside from _the difference in abilities_ used.

#important **Possibly Requires:** #martialist  weapons

_**Suggested Specialties:** Athletics, [martial arts], Patience, Quick Reflexes, [weapons]..._

> ##### Specific Factors:
>
> - “Adamantly _not_ injuring your opponent, to train, show off, or humiliate...?
> - “Fighting on rooftops, across tree branches, or on thin ice...?
> - “Throwing someone across the room, or jumping much further than expected...?

**Note:** This job may also require an _ascetic background_, or the [[Honor]] capability, if that's appropriate for your setting.
