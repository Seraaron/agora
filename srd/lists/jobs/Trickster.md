> #### Illusionist
> 
> With the permission of your [[Peers]], you may rename this job to 'Illusionist' and add the #magic tag — making your dice [[Exploding Dice|explode]] — to allow you to use this job to perform *more than just parlor tricks*.
> 
> With Illusionist, you can create 'gossamer tricks' — simple single-word charms, that require only a flick of the fingers and no premeditation — though they are easily broken. The difficulty of these spells follow from their effects, below, plus any specific factors, above, or [[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]].
> 
> 1. **Strange Noise:** Cause a distraction with a distant sound, originating from a point within sight, or mimic the call of a known voice or animal cry.
> 2. **Light Trick:** Blur the outlines of something, see in double, cause a shimmering effect, produce rainbows, images, swirls, or facades.
> 3. **Disappear:** Bend light around to make objects and people appear to vanish from the sight of specific observers. The trick may still be detected by other senses though.
> 4. **Mesmerize:** Leave someone dazed and confused, make them follow a simple command or answer a 'yes/no' question honestly, or put them to sleep.
> 5. **Dreamscape:** View or enter the dreams and memories of another person with a touch. You enter a trance as you do, and project into their mind.
> 
> **Note:** None of these effects are exactly 'real'. An illusion cannot cause physical harm, nor can they threaten the life of another, or make someone do something abhorrent. *This is not mind control*.
