### Brawler ([[Endurance|End]])

#athletic #martial #rogue

Boxing and hand-to-hand fighting, using any natural weapons available to you, such as fists, feet, claws, and teeth, often while unarmored or poorly armored. Includes using improvised and specialist brawler weapons too, like bats, brass knuckles, and push-knives, or a cestus (punching gauntlet).

May be used during [[Martial Conflict|combat]] to make melee attacks, using the target's  poise as the base difficulty, and can be used to grapple an opponent to the ground.

May also include making and using improvisational weapons, or using-tools as weapons, using [[Finesse]].

Â¶ **Possibly Requires:** #brawler, #natural, or improvised weapons

_**Suggested Specialties:** Intimidation, Improvisation, [martial arts], Natural [armor / weapons], Quick Reflexes..._

> #### Wrestling Matches & Barfights
>
> Not every fight needs to be as tactical or as complex as a [[Martial Conflict|full combat]], especially not when everyone's using Brawler. Sometimes you just need to knock someone out cold, or lock them to the ground and bind them, or perhaps you're just having a punch up in a tavern. In these cases, use an [[Opposed Tasks|Opposed Task]] roll and add your armor dice to your defensive pool.
