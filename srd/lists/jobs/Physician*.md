### Physician ([[Resolve|Res]])

#academic #civic #medical

Diagnosing and treating health problems or disabilities, via consultation, psychiatry, physiotherapy, medical prescription, and other forms of care — though even this work rarely takes on a fully curative form. Includes some pharmaceutical and antibiotic knowledge too (ie. the making of drugs and medicines, and how to reduce the spread of diseases).

May also be used to perform surgery, using [[Finesse]].
