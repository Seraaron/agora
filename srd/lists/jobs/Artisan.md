### Artisan ([[Appeal|App]])

#artistic #craft #civic

Plying a specialized artistic trade or handicraft. Producing goods in limited quantities or batches, or offering bespoke services, often using traditional methods. Particularly involves decorating pre-fabricated objected in new and interesting ways, via engraving, sculpture, stenciling, threadwork, or painting, etc.

Depending on what you're doing, it may be more appropriate to use [[Finesse]] instead.

#imp **Requires:** A workshop, materials, &or #artistic-tools or #craft-tools

_**Suggested Specialties:** Composition, [culture], Design, [genre], [handicraft]..._

> #### Creating Capital
>
> The Artisan job can be used to create works of art, which may function as [[Assets and Gear|assets]]. In this case, **the base difficulty of the roll is equal to _twice the value of the dice rating_ you wish to create, then +1 for each additional tag, and any [[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]]**. The time taken is then measured in months equal to the final difficulty, which creates [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]] for the other players.
>
> Unfortunately, _value isn't always derived from skill_. So the die rating of the art you create is only it's **maximum worth** if you can find a buyer willing to take it from you at that price, otherwise you will have to sell it for less. Beyond that point, the art may be sold on again at higher prices (without limit), but you will not receive anything from those transactions except acclaim.
