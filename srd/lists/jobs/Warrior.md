### Warrior ([[Finesse|Fin]])

#athletic #civic #martial

Fighting with whatever sophisticated melee weapons are appropriate for your culture using traditional techniques, often while heavily armored. Also includes dueling a single opponent with matched weapons, in accordance with some agreed-upon code or law.

May be used during [[Martial Combat|combat]] to make melee attacks, using the target's  poise as the base difficulty, and can inflict a final killing blow without a [[Grit]] check. Can also be used for the final shot when [[Hunter|hunting]] big game.

#imp **Requires:** #warrior weapons, and #armor or a #shield

_**Suggested Specialties:** [armor], Athletics, Competition, Quick Reflexes, [weapons]..._

> #### A Murder Most Foul!

> Killing in cold blood requires that you make an [[Archer]], [[Gunner]], [[Skirmisher]], or [[Warrior]] roll (with [[Grit]]). _Murder_ implies that the target is **not also trying to kill you**, so this could be done with an [[Opposed Tasks#Asymmetrical Opposition|Asymetrically Opposed task]]. However, the rules of Asymmetrical tasks state that the defending character can effectively _“set the conditions under which they would accept defeat”_, and anyone with a sense of self-preservation would likely never accept defeat when their life is on the line.
>
> Instead, it may be _fairer_ to use a [[Opposed Tasks#Symmetrical Opposition|Symmetrical Opposition]] and have the targeted character roll their [[Acrobat]], [[Guard]], [[Martialist]], or [[Trickster]] job, and make the consequences lop-sided: **If you win then you kill them, if they win then they escape with their life**.
>
> You may add your weapon dice to this roll, and your target may add any armor or shield dice to theirs (or use their [[Martial Combat#Poise|poise]] as the base difficulty). Attempting to murder someone is _always [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]]_.
>
> If a character is fighting back fully, then you both have the intent to kill and thus must both use one of the aforementioned jobs (with [[Grit]]), or else progress to a full [[Martial Combat|combat]].
>
> #que If you're not using Grit in your campaign then use [[Resolve]] instead.

**Note:** This job may also require a _noble background_, or the [[Honor]] capability, if that's appropriate for your setting.
