### Rider ([[Endurance|End]])

#animal #laborious #martial #vehicle

Riding animals of all sizes, primarily for the purpose of long-distance transport or leisure. Includes maintenance of all associated equipment and provisions. Also includes operating personal vehicles such as bikes, sleds, or scooters, if that's appropriate for your setting.

Must be used to reposition in [[Martial Conflict|combat]] while riding, and may be used to determine your poise in that case too  (in combination with your mount's barding).

If racing or jockeying then use [[Swiftness]] instead.

¶ **Requires:** A mount or vehicle

_**Suggested Specialties:** [animal], Athletics, Competition, Mounted Combat, [vehicle]..._

> ##### Specific Factors:
>
> - “Riding throughout the night, or riding in bad weather...?
> - “Taking an off-road shortcut, or traveling through wilderness...?
> - “Your steed doesn't like you...?
