### Archer ([[Swiftness|Swi]])

#athletic  #martial

Loosing projectiles with elastic-powered ranged weapons, such as longbows, crossbows, and slingshots. Mainly used during [[Martial Combat|martial combat]] to make ranged attacks, using the target's poise as the base difficulty, and can inflict a final killing blow without a [[Grit]] check. Can also be used for the final shot when [[Hunter|hunting]] big game.

May also include the tillering and crafting of your own bows or crossbows, as well as fetching your own arrows or bolts, using [[Wits]].

> You don't have to worry about counting and tracking individual bolts and arrows — _though you must declare before shooting what ammo type you'll be using_ — instead we can assume that you have enough arrows to last a few battles before you must restock: **_Roll a d6 after every other fight_, and if you roll a 1 then you only have one arrow remaining**.

**Note:** This job is usually replaced with [[Gunner]] if playing in a more contemporary setting.
