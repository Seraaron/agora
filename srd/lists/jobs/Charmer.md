### Charmer ([[Appeal|App]])

#intrigue #social

Seducing or socially disarming someone for any reason, by being flaunty, or deceptive, or using the power of suggestion, or some other subtle trick. Also includes socially influencing and outmaneuvering others for personal gain, or to progress a plot or scheme. Can also be used to _genuinely_ attract or please a partner.

May be used during a [[Social Discourse|social discourse]] to flatter or persuade, or to incite specific reactions, using your opponent's presence as the difficulty, and the level may also be used to determine your own presence.

_**Suggested Specialties:** Confidence, Lies, Flattery, Persuasion, Seduction..._


> ##### Specific Factors:
>
> - “The last person you asked refused or rejected you...?
> - “Your motivations are political, or you're being ungenuine...?
> - “You're asking them to do something that goes against their ethics, morality, taste, or principles...?

**Note:** This is _not_ mind control, and shouldn't be treated as such. Also, you _must get permission_ from the controlling player to use this on a [[Player Characters|Player Character]] or [[VINPCs|VINPC]].
