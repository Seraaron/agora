### Thief ([[Finesse|Fin]])

#civic #financial #rogue

Picking locks and pockets, finding and disarming traps, looting and scavenging. Moving stealthily _by yourself_, especially in cities or buildings, and generally passing without a trace. Also a bit of a catch-all for any _non-violent_ criminal odd-jobs.

May also include smuggling illegal goods or contraband, using [[Wits]].
