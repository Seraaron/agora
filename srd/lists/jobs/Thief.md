### Thief ([[Finesse|Fin]])

#civic #financial #rogue

Picking locks and pockets, finding and disarming traps, looting and scavenging. Moving stealthily *by yourself*, especially in cities or buildings, and generally passing without a trace. Also a bit of a catch-all for any non-violent criminal odd-jobs.

May also include smuggling illegal goods or contraband, using [[Wits]].
