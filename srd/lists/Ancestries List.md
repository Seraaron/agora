#### Random Ancestries

You don't have to roll for your ancestry, but you can if you want to:

|   2d6  | Ancestry / Species   | _Average Size_ |
| :----: | :------------------- | :------------- |
|  2-3.  | **Beastfolk**        | Small — Modest |
|   4.   | **Arcadian**, Goblin | Small          |
|   5.   | **Arcadian**, Dwarf  | Modest         |
|  6-8.  | **Human**            | _Modest_       |
|   9.   | **Arcadian**, Elf    | Modest         |
|   10.  | **Arcadian**, Orc    | Ample          |
| 11-12. | **Beastfolk**        | Ample — Large  |

## Humans

**Humans are the default species.** _You are assumed to be human unless otherwise specified_. They are the most likely to be rolled (if you roll for your ancestry), and the most populous people in most settings — or the _only_ people, in some worlds.

Humans are sapient bipedal animals, descended from apes, or crafted by the new gods. They are tailless mammals, with very little hair or fur besides that on their heads, and their skin-tones can vary beautifully from region to region. They are _acutely social beings_. An unsteady balance seems to have been struck between their altruistic and individualistic natures, and that is at the heart of almost all of their conflicts.

### Human Benefits

Humans are the most versatile of all ancestries. Not inherently magical, and not particularly talented at any one thing, but adaptable to almost any setting or situation. _Perhaps that is the reason they are so numerous...?_

**Gambit:** _Choose any (basic grade) [[Gambits List#Commonplace Gambits|Commonplace Gambit]]_.

**Condition:** _Roll on the [[D666 Conditions]] table_.

**Specialty:** _Choose anything from the [[Specialties List]]_.

###### Variant Humans

Humans are a 'modest' [[Size|size]], on average, though some settings allow for more variety across the world:

- Small humans may be called 'halflings'.
- Modest humans may be called 'goliaths'.
- Large humans may be called 'giants'.

To play as one of these variant humans, you'll need to check with your [[Facilitator|FC]] to see if they're present in the setting. These variants all share the same benefits as humans, _the only difference is their average size_.

## Arcadians

#unfinished 

'Arcadian' is the common collective term for all humanoid beings that descended from the Fâe. It refers to refers to the idea that they originate from an idyllic time before humans or beasts ever existed — before the gods, even. Arcadians are androgynous and long-lived, most have pointed ears and vividly colored eyes, and some can even grow horns, tusks, manes, or antlers.

There are four main arcadian ancestries, usually categorized by their associated **seasonal court**, _but perhaps others exist too?_ These are also known as arcadian 'dialects', because their written words are identical, but the way they speak them — and the philosophies they embody — can differ greatly.

| _Fâe  Court_ | Common Name | Dialectic Condition           | _Sterotypical Features_                                                                           |
| :----------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| _Spring_     | **Goblin**  | [[#Curiosity Killed the Cat]] | _Dexterous and inquisitve, watery skin-tones, shadowy hair-colors, audacious personalities, etc._ |
| _Summer_     | **Orc**     | [[#Fight Fire With Fire]]     | _Vigorous and athletic, fiery skin-tones, leafy hair-colors, boisterous personalities, etc._      |
| _Autumn_     | **Dwarf**   | [[#Progress at All Costs]]    | _Short and stout, stony skin-tones, ruddy hair-colors, conscientious personalities, etc._         |
| _Winter_     | **Elf**     | [[#First Born]]               | _Tall and lithe, icy skin-tones, snowy hair-colors, surreptitious personalities, etc._            |

### Arcadian Benefits

**Arcadians all share the same [[Fae Borne]] gambit** (at the basic grade), and only _really_ differ by their 'Dialectic Conditions' (see below).

![[Fae Borne]]

In effect, this means that _your [[Age|age]] is relative to other arcadians_, not to humans. **By the time an arcadian is considered 'young', a human is considered 'old'.**

❓ You may choose to upgrade this gambit to unlock the customization option, but this will cost [[Character Assembly#4 Character Assembly Points|caps]], _as per the normal rules_.

---

###### Philosophy of Shape

There is no objective sense of 'order' or 'chaos' among the Fâe, no 'light' or 'dark' either, just different points of view that cycle around like the seasons.

Arcadians cannot lose their 'dialectic conditions' to [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]. Instead, when catharsis occurs, their philosophy must shift. When their mind changes in this way, so too does their form. _Thus a goblin may become an elf, or a dwarf an orc, and so on_. **When you erase your condition to regain [[Ego]], you must replace it with one of the other arcadian dialects** (below), _or make up a new one_, and thus change your appearance too. It is this this struggle between extremes that is at the heart of most arcadian conflict.

In ages past — _in the so-called 'ice ages'_ — the elven dialect dominated, and the world was plunged into winter for millennia. In more recent times, _geologically speaking_, the orcen way won out and all the lands were lush with vegetation. In the current era, _from a human perspective_, the balance seems quite stable... but it would only take a small revolution in Fâe politics to change the face of the earth once more. _Perhaps such a shift is already underway?_

❗ Due to how [[Conditions|conditions]] work, mechanically, there is a natural dichotomy in every dialect too. _Do you indulge the ideas, or resist them?_ Sometimes they can be beneficial, other times they can lead to disaster. **Exploring this space is part of the fun of playing an arcadian**.

❓ Like all conditions, you can _of course_, change the words to suit your preferred play style. The difference in this case is that the change will  affect all other arcadians who also share your dialect. _So it's worth discussing the it first with your [[Facilitator|FC]] and any other arcadian players_.

#### Goblins

_Goblins are 'small' in [[Size|size]]._ They can hide easily from the sight of bigger folks (standing at 3 to 4 feet tall, on average), which makes it easier for them to play tricks, though they are not as small as pixies or spites.

##### Curiosity Killed the Cat

Goblen kind are naturally curious, but they also _know_ that they're naturally curious. When a goblin's mischievous spirit contributes one too many times to a close brush with death, they might start thinking twice about being so nosey.

This can be beneficial while exploring, inventing, sneaking around, and generally just letting themselves make gut decisions; but it can be paralyzing to a goblin faced with multiple similar options, or when they're put in positions of power. The more abstract the problem, the more likely that they'll heed caution.

#### Orcs

_Orcs are an 'ample' [[Size|size]]._ They tower above most other peoples of the earth (standing at 7 to 8 feet tall, on average), and they know how to throw their weight around effectively, though they are not as big as trolls or giants.

##### Fight Fire With Fire

unsure... alternatives:

- "Might Makes Right"
- #rewrite 

#### Dwarves

_Dwarves are a 'modest' [[Size|size]]._ They are often shorter than humans (standing at 4 to 5 feet tall, on average), and wider too, though they're not as small as goblins.

##### Progress at All Costs

Dwarven kind carved themselves from stone, or so it's said. By _sheer force of will_, they came into this world. Once a dwarf sets their mind to something, they may not stop at _anything_ until it gets done, even to the detriment of their own health or relationships.

Similarly, they can suffer tunnel vision from time to time, losing track of time in the process. Never pausing to appreciate just how far they've already come. This has it's benefits, of course, but it's also the reason why dwarven halls and cities are often far larger than they need to be to house their populace.

#### Elves

_Elves are a 'modest' [[Size|size]]._ They are often taller than humans (standing at 6 to 7 feet tall, on average), and thinner too, though they're not as big as orcs.

##### Slow and Steady Wins the Race

unsure... alternatives:

- "First Born"
- #rewrite 

## Beastfolk

#unfinished 

'Beastfolk' is the common collective term for all anthropomorphic sapient beings that are thought to descend from the old gods — _the animal gods_. There is so much variety among the beastfolk — and so much wrapped up in folklore and mythology — that it can be difficult to properly separate them into individual subspecies.

In general though, the beastkin take on the appearance of both a human and an animal in mixed proportions. For some, it may just be a single feature — animalistic ears, a fluffy tail, horns, scales, or sharp fangs — for others it may be more of a _whole body experience_.

> ### Eg.
>
> **Small:** _Kobold, Wererat, Vānara, Mog, Myrmidon, Salamander, etc._
>
> **Modest:** _Satyr, Mer, Kitsune, Werecat, Harpy, Saurid, Tengu, etc._
>
> **Ample:** _Gnole, Werewolf, Draconid, Nāga, Lamia, Sahagin, etc._
>
> **Large:** _Minotaur, Centaur, Scorpionid, Wereshark, Dracopede, etc._

❓ If you're playing in a _science fiction_ setting, you can modify this ancestry to portray a variety of alien species instead.

### Beastfolk Benefits

**Beastfolk all share the same [[Beasthood]] gambit** (at the basic grade), but this alone can produce quite a lot of variety, especially if you spend caps to upgrade it.

![[Beasthood]]

❓ _Unless otherwise specified_, you can assume that beastfolk live about as long as humans do. Beastfolk are considered 'mortal' to the arcadians.

#### Inherent Condition

#rewrite 

For beastfolk, their 'inherent conditions' embed a core struggle. A dichotomy of instincts that they either have to find a balance between, or learn to cope with, or else throw out entirely. **Roll a d6 or choose one of the following inherent conditions and its associated struggle:**

1. Strength _vs._ Intelligence
2. Reason _vs._ Passion
3. Illumination _vs._ Obfuscation
4. Order _vs._ Chaos
5. Unity _vs._ Isolation
6. Civilization _vs._ Wilderness

Unlike [[#Philosophy of Shape|arcadians]], Beastfolk _can_ lose their inherent condition to [[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]], which usually indicates that they've put aside or overcome some aspect of their core struggle.

###### Mixed Heritage

To play as a descendant of multiple ancestries, you will need permission from your [[Peers]], and you'll then have to purchase the right [[Gambits|gambits]] and [[Conditions|conditions]] with your own [[Caps Menu|caps]] during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]]. Mechanically, _that's all there is to it_ — but the ramifications in roleplaying terms is something that you'll have to work out for yourselves.
