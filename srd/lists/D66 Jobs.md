## D66 Jobs

During [[Character Assembly|character assembly]], after you choose your character's [[Circumstances#Age|age]], roll one to four D66s on the table below gain +1 level in a random [[Jobs|job]], _for free_. This represents a common set of skills that a person could tangentially pick up during their lifetime, in almost any setting.

**To roll a D66:** roll 2d6 and take the one that lands closest to your left as the tens digit, and the one that lands to your right as the unitary digit. _This gives up to 36 possible outcomes._
