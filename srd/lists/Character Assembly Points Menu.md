###### Character Assembly Points Menu

---

##### Job Costs:

-   Use the **[[Jobs List]]** to choose your [[Jobs|jobs]].
-   All job levels cost **2 caps** each.
-   Five is the maximum job level at character creation.

#que Ordinary flatpacks usually give about 20 levels to distribute among a list of pre-set options (which would cost about 40 caps to match), higher tier flatpacks may give more job levels.

##### Specialty Costs:

-   Use the **[[Specialties List]]** to choose your [[Specialties|specialties]].
-   Your first specialty is _free_.
-   After that, each new specialty costs a number of caps equal to the number of specialties you already have.
    -   So getting your second specialty costs **1 cap**, the third costs **2 caps**, fourth costs **3 caps**, and so on.

#que That's quite a hard cumulative calculation to do in your head, so here's a handy table for reference:

| â„– of Specialties | Total Cost |
| :--------------: | :--------: |
|         1        |    free    |
|         2        |    1 cap   |
|         3        |   3 caps   |
|         4        |   6 caps   |
|         5        |   10 caps  |
|         6        |   15 caps  |
|         7        |   21 caps  |
|         8        |   28 caps  |
|         9        |   36 caps  |
|        10        |   45 caps  |
|        11        |   55 caps  |
|        12        |   66 caps  |

#que Ordinary flatpacks usually give about five or six specialties (which would cost 10 or 15 caps to match), higher tier flatpacks may give more specialties.

##### Assets & Gear Costs:

-   [[Assets and Gear#Capital Assets|Capital asset]] dice cost **4 caps** per die.
    -   See the **[[Captial Asset Examples List]]**, for guidance.
-   [[Assets and Gear#Prestigious Assets|Prestigious asset]] dice cost **1 cap** for the first die, **2 caps** for the second die, **3 caps** for the third, and so on (similar to specialties, [[#Specialty Costs|above]]).
    -   See the **[[Prestigious Asset Examples List]]**, for guidance.
-   [[Assets and Gear#Gear|Gear]] in the **[[Gear Examples List]]** each have their own costs.
    -   Generally, the more dice and [[Tags List|tags]] they have the more expensive they get.
    -   #open-ended  items are especially costly.

#que It's difficult to compare to flatpacks here, because they are so variable.

##### Condition Costs:

-   Use the **[[D666 Conditions]]** to to choose your [[Conditions|conditions]].
-   You may take up to three conditions for _free_.
-   Each additional condition beyond three costs **1 cap** each.
    -   Up to a maximum of six.

#que This is the same as with flatpacks, though some let you choose more than three. Still, conditions are always optional; you don't have to choose any if you don't want to.

##### Kith & Kin Costs:

-   You may take up three [[VINPCs|kith or kin]] NPCs for _free_.
-   This limit cannot be increased without the FC's permission.

#que This is the same as with flatpacks.

##### Gambit Costs:

-   Use the **[[Gambits List]]** to choose your [[Gambits|gambits]], if any.
    -   Gambits are locked off in tiers.
    -   You cannot take a gambit of a higher tier than your character.
-   Your first gambit of the same tier as your character costs **6 caps**.
-   Your first gambit of a lower tier than your character costs  **3 caps**.
-   Each additional gambit costs **5 caps**, regardless of tier.

#que Most ordinary flatpacks either don't offer any Gambits, or will only let you choose one from a small selection; and even the higher tier flatpacks only give you a few.

#imp The only other way to obtain a gambit then, is to make one your [[Exclusive Feature]], with your [[Facilitator|FC's]] permission.
