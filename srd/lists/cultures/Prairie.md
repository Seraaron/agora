### Prairie Culture

_People of the steppes and the great plains. Nomads, farmers, and hunters alike, who all use animals to carry them across the grass seas. Those who were 'born in the saddle', as they say._ This culture especially represents any steppe-dwellers who've stuck to their methods and traditions even in the face of a rapidly-changing world.
