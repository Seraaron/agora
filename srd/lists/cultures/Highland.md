### Highland Culture

_Agricultural people who track animals across the great moors, and quarry the foothills for ore, coal, and stone, providing for towns and cities. Their rustic and somewhat-sheltered lifestyle is often envied, but rarely pursued._ These people are often considered 'cultural cousins' to both [[Woodland|woodlanders]] and [[Lowland|lowlanders]], but are often treated as 'country bumpkins' by cityfolk.
