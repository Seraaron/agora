### Boreal Culture

_People from the sylvan valleys and deep temperate woodlands. Supposedly related to the plant-dwelling fair folk. Those who found what they were looking for in those ancient forests and never came back. Some even build houses among the trees._ You can use this culture to represent a stereotypical view of _[[Ancestries List#Orcs|orcs]]_ or _[[Ancestries List#Elves|elves]]_ in your setting, or just use it to refer to those who emulate their lifestyle.
