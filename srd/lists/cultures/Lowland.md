### Lowland Culture

_Agricultural people who provide food for all the towns and cities, and try to spare some for themselves too. Their rustic and somewhat-sheltered lifestyle is often envied, but rarely pursued._ These people are often considered 'cultural cousins' to both [[Highland|highlanders]] and [[Woodland|woodlanders]], but are often treated as 'country bumpkins' by cityfolk.
