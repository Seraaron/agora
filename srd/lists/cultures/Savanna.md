### Savanna Culture

_People from the rural brushlands and subtropical dry forests. Hunter-gatherers and villagers mainly. A determined, unshakable, people. Able and willing to feed their whole village. Their sense of community is strong._ This culture especially represents any brush-dwellers who've stuck to their methods and traditions even in the face of a rapidly-changing world.
