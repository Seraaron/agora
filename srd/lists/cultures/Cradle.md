### Cradle Culture

_People from a place where ‘civilization’ began, or is just beginning. A lush river valley, or flood plain, where the climate's reliable, the animals are happy, and the land is fertile and pleasant._ This can be used as a default city culture in certain regions, or it can represent actively developing societies.
