### Wall Culture

_Feudal townsfolk; especially serfs, guardsmen, and members of a local militia. Those who live in places frequently threatened by war or crime. Walled in for their own safety. Often reliant on imports and external aid._ This can be used as a default city culture in certain regions, or it can represent isolate or feudal societies.
