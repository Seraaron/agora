### Imperial Culture

_Aristocratic types; courtiers and nobles especially. Entrepreneurs and business-people. Those taught colonialistic values, who have become rich from exploitation and inheritance. Often sworn by rituals of fealty._ This is most often used to represent the privileged classes in a stratified society, but it can also be used to indicate a generally decadent cultural attitude.

**Note:** Imperial people are usually also [[Honor|Honor-bound]]. If they are not, then this culture represents a more modern, _capitalistic_, view of the aristocracy and may be called the 'Capital' culture instead.
