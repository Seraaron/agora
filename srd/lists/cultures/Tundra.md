### Tundra Culture

_Nomadic people from the rural polar steppes and icy tundras. Hunter-gatherers mainly, with strong traditions of hospitality. Weary travelers lost in the snow are always kept after as well as family._ This culture especially represents any taiga-dwellers who've stuck to their methods and traditions even in the face of a rapidly-changing world.
