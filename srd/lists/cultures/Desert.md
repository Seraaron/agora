### Desert Culture

_Nomadic people from the xeric shrubs and sandy dunes. Reliant on animals for meat and water, often travelling with their herds. The desert is unforgiving, and family bonds are strengthened in its heat._ This culture especially represents any desert-dwellers who've stuck to their methods and traditions even in the face of a rapidly-changing world.
