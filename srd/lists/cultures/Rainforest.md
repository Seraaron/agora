### Rainforest Culture

_People from the rural jungles and tropical woodlands. Hunter-gatherers mainly. Free, proud, and fiercely independent. They would protect the forests they rely on from any who threaten it._ This culture especially represents any jungle-dwellers who've stuck to their methods and traditions even in the face of a rapidly-changing world.
