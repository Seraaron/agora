### Pillar Culture

_People of principle; poets and philosophers especially. Those who live their lives by strict laws, but also those who aren't afraid to ask ‘who wrote the laws’ and ‘why’. They uphold the mantle of shared knowledge._ This can be used as a default city culture in certain regions, or it can represent hyper-rationalist societies.
