### Woodland Culture

_Agricultural people who rely on the woods or swamps for food and crafts, often supplying cities with building materials. Their rustic and somewhat-sheltered lifestyle is often envied, but rarely pursued._ These people are often considered 'cultural cousins' to both [[Highland|highlanders]] and [[Lowland|lowlanders]], but are often treated as 'country bumpkins' by cityfolk.
