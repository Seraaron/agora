# Tags List

-   #ammo_X — Count exact quantities of remaining ammunition for ranged weapons, using x, if that's important for your game.
-   #ancient — The asset is so old that it comes from another era, a time that no-one alive today remembers, and is barely functional (unless it's also #magical) but may be of value to those with specific interests.
