# Tags List

-   **`ammo [x]`** — count exact quantities of remaining ammunition for ranged weapons, using x, if that's important for your game
-   **`ancient`** — the asset is so old that it comes from another era, a time that no-one alive today remembers, and is barely functional (unless it's also `magical`) but may be of value to those with specific interests
-   **`armor`** — makes explicitly clear that the asset can be used as armor, if it's not obvious, using its die rating as bonus dice to defense
- **`automatic`** — makes explicitly clear that some aspect of this asset is automated or works by itself with no additional input, or that it's an automatic firearm, if it's not obvious
-   **`breakable [x]`** — the asset can be used repeatedly until you roll a number of 1s all at once on a single Task, equal to x, then it gains the 'broken' tag
-   **`broken`** — the asset must be [[repaired]] before it can be used again, which may also affect its retail value (remove the `broken` tag once repaired)
-   **`bulky`** — the object is physically bulky, even if it's not `heavy`, and you can only carry or wield one at a time
-   **`captial`** — makes explicitly clear that the asset also has a capital value
-   **`cash`** — the asset can be treated as money, using it's die rating as its value, in lieu of actual currency, if it's not obvious
-   **`consumable`** — makes explicitly clear that the item must be ingested, destroyed, or otherwise expended to be used, if it's not obvious
-   **`cumbersome`** — this is a combination of the `bulky` _and_ `heavy` tags to save sheet space, the object must be carried by two or more people, or else you need a [[Specialties|specialty]] for that specific item
-   **`[damage type]`** — replace with any damage type for weapons, if that's important for your game, _for example:_ `sharp`, `blunt`,  `knock-back`, `shock`, `poison`, or `fire`, or that it applies a specific `[adversity]` on hit
-   **`dangerous [x]`** — using this asset is a risk, and it can back-fire and hurt you or those around you when you roll a number of 1s all at once on a single Task, equal to x
-   **`empty`** — indicates that the asset is empty, and must be refilled before it can be used again
-   **`equipped`**  — makes explicitly clear that the item is currently equipped or on your person and easily accessible
-   **`gear`** — makes explicitly clear that the asset is a piece of gear, if it's not obvious
-   **`heavy`** — the item is physically heavy, even if it's not `bulky`, and you can only carry or wield one at a time
-   **`[job category] tool`** — replace with any [[Jobs List#Sort Order|job category]] as a tag to make explicitly clear that this asset can used as a tool for jobs of that category, if it's not obvious
-   **`large`** — _can have differing contextual meanings:_
    -   that it can only be equipped or used by someone who is of [[Circumstances#Size|size]] 'large', if it's a weapon or piece of armor, or else needs a [[Specialties|specialty]]
    -   that the asset is particularly large compared to others of its kind
    -   that the asset is physically large and difficult to hide
-   **`limited-use [x]`** — the asset can be only be used a finite number of times, equal to x, then it becomes `empty` or `broken` or removed entirely
-   **`long`** — _can have differing contextual meanings:_
    -   that it has a **long reach** (like a spear) if it's a melee weapon
    -   that it has a **long range** (>150m) if it's a ranged weapon
    -   that it's just physically long
-   **`melee`** — makes explicitly clear that the item can be used as a melee weapon, if it's not obvious, so it must be used in close-quarters
-   **`open-ended`** — the dice rolled when you use this asset will explode, like a [[Die of Fortune]], and are rolled separately
-   **`piercing [x]`** — ignores up to x dice from a target's armor and/or shield when used as a weapon
-   **`prestige`** — makes explicitly clear that the asset also carries its own prestige which confers to the owner
-   **`quick`** — _can have differing contextual meanings:_
    -   that the **attack rate** is quick compared to other melee weapons
    -   that the **reload speed** is quick compared to other ranged weapons
    -   that it literally moves quickly, or makes you move quickly
-   **`ranged`** — makes explicitly clear that the item can be used as a ranged weapon, if it's not obvious, so it must be used at a distance
-   **`rank [x]`** — the dice rolled when you use this asset have their own rank, and are rolled separately
-   **`rare`** — indicates that the asset is rare, and probably more valuable if it can be sold, if that's important to make clear
-   **`shield`** — makes explicitly clear that the item can be used as a shield, if it's not obvious, using its die rating as bonus dice to attack or defense
-   **`small`** — _can have differing contextual meanings:_

    -   that it has a **short range** (<30m) if it's a ranged weapon
    -   that it's just physically short
-   **`single-use`** — this is functionally equivalent to the `limited-use 1` tag, but is shorter to write, and may save sheet space

    -   that the **reload speed** is slow compared to other ranged weapons
    -   that it literally moves slowly, or makes you move slowly
