---

###### #ammo-type

- The damage type of this weapon depends on what type of ammo you load into it.
	- **See:** [[Ammo Types]] and [[Ammo Quantities]]

---

###### #ablative

- This item can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] like a #shield to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent or a freak accident.
	- The item is destroyed, and you gain a point of stress, but at least you'll still be alive.

---

###### #any-melee

- You can use any melee job to attack with this weapon, as though it had all three melee job tags: #brawler #martialist #warrior.

---

###### #any-ranged

- You can use any ranged job to attack with this weapon, as though it had all three ranged job tags: #archer #hunter #gunner.
- Cannot be used from a 'remote' range, unless it also has a #scope.

---

###### #archer

- Use with the [[Archer]] job to make ranged attack rolls with this weapon.

---

###### #armor

- Add the armor's dice rating to the _first part_ of your poise calculation while worn.
- However, you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor to all rolls related to stealth, or swimming, climbing, and other acrobatics or mobility.
	- These penalties are negated by #quiet and #flexible, respectively.
- All armor also has the #worn tag for free.

---

###### #artillery

- Add a +1D bonus to all attacks made with this weapon while it is mounted on a turret, but attacks made with it if it's dismounted cannot benefit from being #light or #heavy.

---

###### #auto

- This #firearm will continuously chamber and fire rounds while the trigger is pulled, granting a +2 bonus die to [[Spur]] and [[Rout]] (flank) attacks.

---

###### #barding

- Add the item's dice to the last part of your poise calculation (instead of a shield) while riding the creature that's wearing the barding.
- Barding may not be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] like a shield.

---

###### #bashing

- Inflicts wound with blunt force trauma that can break bones or cause internal bleeding. This can take [[Medical Treatment|seasons]] to heal from.
- See [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] for [[Spur]] damage.

---

###### #bayonet

- You may treat this item as a #piercing #brawler weapon when the bayonet is attached, but it also adds a +1 difficulty factor to your ranged attacks.
- The bayonet can also be used separately as a common-quality dagger.

---

###### #binding

- Inflicts wound with lacerations and shallow cuts, or dislocations and small impacts. This can take [[Medical Treatment|weeks]] to heal from.
- Grants a +1D bonus to [[Grapple]] and [[Disarm]] attack rolls.
- See [[Damage Type vs Armor Weight|damage lookup table]] for [[Spur]] damage.

❓ This is the default damage type for a weapon, if none other is specified.

---

###### #brawler

- Use with the [[Brawler]] job to make melee attack rolls with this weapon.

---

###### #broken

- This item is #damaged beyond [[Repairing Items|repair]], it may still be possible to salvage some of the materials, or it may still be of interest to a specialist, but otherwise it's just a heap of junk now.

---

###### #bullet-proof

- Shields with this tag can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent from a #firearm.
	- This supersedes the #hardened tag.
- Armor and helmets with this tag each add +1 to your poise _at the end of the normal calculation_ making offensive moves harder to use against you, which firearms cannot ignore.

---

###### #burning

- Inflicts wounds with fire and heat, or chemical corrosion, causing flesh to burn and blister. This can take [[Medical Treatment|months]] to heal from.
- Deals 7 stamina damage on hit, regardless of what armor the target has (unless they are [[Damage Resistant|immune]] to burning).

---

###### #cash-money 

- This item serves no function except to be spent or sold, adding its dice to a single financial roll in the process.
	- The person you used it on obtains it afterwards, and it can be spent again, and again, passing hands each time.
- Such items can occasionally be split into smaller parts — diving the dice among many rolls, if it makes sense — but once you've run out, you've run out.
- If you're playing in a situation where tracking realistic weights is important, then every _third_ #cash-money item you carry up will effectively gain the #light tag.

---

###### #cavalry

- Add a +1D bonus to all attacks made with this weapon while you are mounted, but attacks made with it on foot cannot benefit from being #light or #heavy.

---

###### #closed

- This helmet encloses your whole face, or covers it with a mask.
- You gain a +1D bonus to [[Intimidate]] (pacify) attempts, but you suffer a +1 penalty to any rolls that test your sense of sight, hearing, or spacial awareness while it's worn.

---

###### #cooling

- While equipped (or when used), you gain a +1D bonus to resisting the effects of hot weather, but you also suffer a +1 difficulty factor when resisting the effects of cold weather.

---

###### #crested

- This helm or headpiece bears a colorful crest, decorative horns, or a wide brim.
- You gain a +1D bonus to [[Rally]] and [[Intimidate]] (pacify) attempts, but this tag also adds one (+1) to the item's [[Carry Weight#Carry Costs|carry cost]].

---

###### #crushing

- Inflicts wounds with crushing force, which can mangle flesh and break bones. This can take [[Medical Treatment|months]] to heal from.
- Deals 6 stamina damage on [[Spur]] hit, regardless of the armor the target has (unless they are [[Damage Resistant|immune]] to crushing).

---

###### #damaged

	- **See:** [[Assets and Gear#Breaking Gear]].

---

###### #fashionable 

- This item initially has one extra die than it's normal rating, *the first time it's worn*, which can be added to certain social rolls.
- Then it grants one fewer die each subsequent time it is worn, until it's die rating is worthless — _equivalent to normal clothes_.

---

###### #firearm

- Ignores poise added by a #shield, #hand-guard, or #barding, but makes a loud noise when used — which might draw unwanted attention to the fight, _making stealth impossible_ — and can be deafening if used indoors.
- You can also [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shatter a shield]] and still [[Kill]] (pacify) your target with this weapon, unless their shield is  #bullet-proof.
- Firearms also tend to be more expensive, due to their abundance of extra tags.

---

###### #flexible

**For armor:**

- You may ignore the +1 difficulty penalty for swimming, climbing, and other acrobatics / mobility rolls that the #armor tag normally applies.

- You may ignore the poise added by shields or hand-guards, but any allies within your close-quarters suffer a +1 difficulty penalty to their attack rolls.

- Deals 5 stamina damage on [[Spur]] hit, regardless of what armor the target has (unless they are [[Damage Resistant|immune]] to freezing).

---

###### #great

- This tag always adds one (+1) to the item's [[Carry Weight#Carry Costs|carry cost]].

**For shields:**

- Shields with this tag can be [[Shields Shall be Shattered|shattered]] to negate a single successful [[Kill]] (pacify) intent from a #great weapon.

---

###### #gunner

- Use with the [[Gunner]] job to make ranged attack rolls with this weapon.
