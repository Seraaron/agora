## Gear List

##### ₡osts

Most gear costs, in *[[¢aps]]*, are calculated by taking one plus the quality (ie. the number of dice) and multiplying them by the number of tags (#). Hyphenated tags (-) tend to be more powerful or complex, so they cost more too. Thus:

$$
Cost (¢) = (1 + Dice) \times \left(\sum(Tags) + \sum(Hyphens)\right)
$$

When buying gear outside of [[Character Assembly|character assembly]], use the cost 

##### `Alternatives`

Some of the gear in this list have alternatives — usually #great variants, for weapons — which are listed in a `monospace font` and have extra tags and a higher cost also listed in that font.

#que If you buy the alt, then it has all of the tags of the main piece plus the extra tags in blue.
