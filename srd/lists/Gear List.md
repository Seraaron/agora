# Gear List

---

###### ₡osts

Most gear costs, in _[[¢aps]]_, are calculated by taking one plus the quality (ie. the number of dice) and multiplying them by the number of tags (#). Hyphenated tags (-) tend to be more powerful or complex, so they cost more too. Thus:

$$
Cost (¢) = (1 + Dice) \times \left(\sum(Tags) + \sum(Hyphens)\right)
$$

When buying gear outside of [[Character Assembly|character assembly]], use the cost to help you set the price using [[Wealth]] or [[Merchant|barter]].

##### Alternative Items?

Some of the gear in this list have alternatives — usually #great variants, for weapons — which are listed in a blue **`monospace font`** and have extra tags and a higher cost also listed in that font.

**If you buy the alt, then it has all of the tags of the main piece plus the extra tags in blue**.

## Magic Items

Magic (or sufficiently high-tech) items are not normally available for purchase. They must either be _earned_ or created from scratch, usually requiring a whole adventure by themselves.

The #magic or #high-tech tags will also usually do more than just make your dice [[Exploding Dice|explode]] too. They grant special powers, or unique effects, that **can't be represented through bonus dice or tags**.

#question Currently, no examples of magic items are provided in the [[Agora]] SRD.
