# Gear List

---

###### ₡osts

Most gear costs, in _[[caps]]_, are calculated by taking one plus the quality (ie. the number of dice) and multiplying them by the number of tags (#). Hyphenated tags (-) tend to be more powerful or complex, so they cost more too. That is:

$$
Gear Cost (¢) = (1 + Dice) \times \left(\sum(Tags) + \sum(Hyphens)\right)
$$

When buying gear outside of [[Character Assembly|character assembly]], use the cost to help you set the price using a [[Wealth]] or a [[Merchant]] roll.

## Tools

**All tools have a #job-tools tag and a weight tag.** Some jobs will say they require certain tools to be used effectively, these are grouped by their [[Jobs List|job tags]].

❓ **If you lack the right set of tools — but you can still improvise or approximate them with other objects — then you'll suffer a +1 difficulty penalty factor.**

❗ If you lack _any_ tools — and can't find or make substitutes — then you'll either suffer a doubled-base difficulty penalty or the [[Facilitator|FC]] may rule that the roll cannot even be attempted.

| Job Tag            |  Weight | _Example Tools_                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :-----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #academic-tools    |  #light | Pen and paper, or quill and ink, a journal, reference material, experimental vessels, graphpaper and spreadsheets, etc.                            |
| #artistic-tools    |  #light | _Paints and brushes, carving knives, canvases or clay, a sketchbook, textiles, a camera, inks and dyes, etc._                                      |
| #craft-tools       | #medium | Hammers and chisels, metal ingots, a crucible or kiln, a lathe, scrapers and planers, a mallet and nails, nuts and bolts, hacksaws, etc.           |
| #financial-tools   |  #light | _An abacus, slide ruler, calculator, or computer, a clock or pocket-watch, pens, and a calendar or planner, etc._                                  |
| #laborious-tools   |  #heavy | Saws and hammers, pulleys, spades and shovels, a pickaxe or mattock, work hatchets, rakes, wrenches, a wheelbarrow, etc.                           |
| #medical-tools     |  #light | _Pins and bandages, painkillers, scalpels and scissors, tweezers, a thermometer, stethoscope, bonesaw, etc._                                       |
| #performance-tools | #medium | Instruments, microphones and amplifiers, costumes and makeup, puppets, a soapbox, etc.                                                             |
| #ritual-tools      | #medium | _Offerings, candles and incense, holy symbols, a mortar and pestle, dice or cards, a sacred blade, alchemical reagents, chalk, blood, etc._        |
| #rogue-tools       |  #light | Locks picks, a file and a hammer, pliers or bolt-cutters, rope and a grappling hook, caltrops, a mirror and compass, a lantern or flashlight, etc. |

## Cash-Money

**All cash, money, or valuable objects have the #cash-money tag.** Cash-money serves no functional purpose other than to be spent or sold. _When spent, add its bonus dice to a [[Wealth]], [[Merchant]], or [[Steward]] roll and then remove it from your inventory._

| Dice | _Roughly Equivalent to..._                                           | ₡ost |
| ---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---: |
| +1   | Underpaid wages, a novelty trinket, a pouch of copper coins, etc.    |   4¢ |
| +2   | Minimum wages, a small gemstone, a pouch of silver coins, etc.       |   6¢ |
| +3   | Good wages, a piece of decent jewelry, a pouch of gold coins, etc.   |   8¢ |
| +4   | High wages, silverware, a diamond ring, a pouch of gemstones, etc.   |  10¢ |
| +5   | Affluent wages, fine art, tapestries, relics, precious bullion, etc. |  12¢ |

You can split some items up into smaller parts, _if it makes sense to do so_.

> ### Eg.
>
> You could go to the bank and exchange a pouch of gold (+3) for a pouch of silver (+2) and a pouch of copper (+1), which can be spent individually rather than all at once.
>
> Or you could spend one third of the gold in the pouch (+1), leaving it with two-thirds left (+2/3).

❓ Cash-money is useful if you're looking for something to spend your last few caps on, but it's **best given out as a reward for completing quests**, or found as 'loot', by your [[Facilitator|FC]].

###### Weight Vs. Value

Normally, cash has no [[Carry Weight|carry weight cost]], but if you're playing in a situation where tracking realistic weights is important — or if your [[Facilitator|FC]] presents you with a classic problem: _A dragon's hoard, worth a hundred dice, but it's all in copper pieces_ — then **every _third_ #cash-money item you pick up will gain the #light tag**, weighing  you down by one point.

###### Magic Items

Magic items — or _sufficiently advanced_ pieces of technology — are not normally available for purchase. They must either be _earned_ or created from scratch, usually requiring a whole adventure by themselves.

The #magic or #high-tech tags will also usually do more than just make your dice [[Exploding Dice|explode]] too. **They confer special powers to the user; unique effects that can't be represented with bonus dice or tags**. Some of these effect may be equivalent to [[Gambits|gambits]], or [[spells]], while others may be completely bespoke.

❓ Currently, no examples of magic items are provided in the [[Agora]] SRD.
