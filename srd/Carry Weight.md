### Carry Weight

We don't often care too much about carry weight limits in [[Agora]]. The simplest rule to follow is: **You can carry as much as makes sense**.

So your [[Peers]] should always help you to judge whether what you're carrying seems reasonable. In fact, _if your game isn't that focused on going on adventure, doing [[Martial Combat|combat]], and collecting gear, then the question may never even arise_.

That said, not everyone knows what it's like to wield real weapons, or wear armor, or carry around bags of gold, or lug around a rucksack full of camping supplies, so here's some guidelines on how to 'make sense' of carry limits.

#### Carry Limit

Your base 'carry limit' is 8 minus your Endurance [[Rank|rank]], **plus a bonus** from your [[Circumstances#Size|size]]:

| Size   |     Carry Limit    | Approx. Comfortable Carry Weight |
| ------ | :----------------: | -------------------------------- |
| Small  |  8 − END **+ 4** | _~30-40 lbs (10-20 kg)_          |
| Modest | 8 − END **+ 8** | _~90-140 lbs (40-60 kg)_         |
| Ample  | 8 − END **+ 14** | _~170-230 lbs (80-100 kg)_       |
| Large  | 8 − END **+ 22** | _~265-360 lbs (120-160 kg)_      |

#que Giving a total carry limit of 12-14 for most adult human characters, for example.

#### Carry Costs

Every bit of [[Gear Examples List|gear]] in the game has [[Tags List|tags]], which functionally define and dictate exactly what that item is. Some of those tags pull double-duty, or even _triple-duty_, and have multiple meanings in different contexts. One of those meanings is in how some tags relate to carry weight.

The following tags have a 'carry cost' which are summed and then subtracted from your carry limit to work out how much is reasonable for you to be able to carry.

|     Tag     | Carry Cost |
| :---------: | ---------- |
|      —      | 0          |
|    #light   | 1          |
|  #balanced  | 2          |
|    #heavy   | 3          |
| #superheavy | 4          |
|    #geat    | +1         |
|   #secret   | −1         |

The #great and #secret tags modify the carry cost of the item they're listed with. This usually indicates that the item just takes up more or less space, respectively, not that it necessarily weighs any more or less.

##### Carrying Characters?

The carry cost of another creature or character is equal to the carry limit _[[#Carry Limit|bonus]]_ of their own size. That is, 4, 8, 14, or 22, respectively. So generally speaking, you can only carry one other character of your own size, or two characters of one size smaller; assuming you're not carrying anything else.

#### Encumbrance

**Once your total carry limit minus all of your carry costs equals zero, you are fully encumbered**. You're still able to move while encumbered, but you must make roll to carry anything else for the rest of the scene and every scene thereafter, until you drop some weight.
