# Development Sessions

A development session or ('dev session' for short) is the collective term for any type of [[Session Structure|game session]] that mainly involves out-of-game discussions between [[Peers]], rather than primarily involving interactions between in game characters.

**A dev session presents an opportunity for you to make big decisions about the game and the direction of the campaign**. Anyone can call for a development session at any time, but they are usually called for by the FC, and there is always a development session at the beginning of a new campaign ‚Äî sometimes called the '**[[#The First Dev Session|session zero]]**'.

## The First Dev Session

This is your pre-game development session (alternatively called a 'zeroth session') that the FC uses to [[Pitching and Planning*|pitch and prepare]] the game world and which players use to [[Character Assembly|create their characters]]. It's also when you should introduce your [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]], and set up a schedule for the game to make sure that everyone knows when to play (and how many sessions the campaign is expected to last).

There's a lot to cover in this first dev session, **it can take a few hours to go through the following list thoroughly**, and you may even find that it takes multiple dev sessions before you _really_ start playing. **This is ok**, especially for newer groups. For long-standing groups going through theses steps will usually go a lot quicker ‚Äî but they should still be covered, even if only briefly.

![[Session Zero Checklist]]

‚ùì Session zeroes aren't required for [[Pitching and Planning*#One-shot Sessions|one-shot sessions]] or [[Pitching and Planning*#Stand-alone Scenarios|stand-alone scenarios]] but you should still brief the players on the game before you hand out character sheets and start playing.

## Later Dev Sessions

After you begin playing your characters and really start to dig into playing a campaign, it's a good idea to plan to run an extra development session between every [[Campaign Arcs|arc]], even if no one specifically asked for one.

‚ùì One dev session every 10-20 sessions is a good rate, but you may find you need to use them more or less frequently, depending on your preferred pace.

**These later dev sessions can be used to achieve several things at once:**

- Debriefing the players on the previous play sessions since the last dev session, reviewing their [[Principles]], and potentially earning [[Fidelity]].
- Catching-up on other character developments, like taking new assets, checking-in with relationships, and [[#Peer Votes|conducting votes]] to earn new features.
- Opening the floor to give feedback and voice opinions about where to take the game next (in broad strokes).
- General [[Taking notes|book-keeping and note sharing]].
- Any other maintenance or upkeep that needs tending to, like shifting the game schedule or changing player roles.

### Changing Features

There is any number of ways that you can conduct a [[Peers#Peer Votes|Peer vote]], but when it comes to changing old features ‚Äî circumstances, specialties, conditions, assets, or gambits ‚Äî or earning new ones, we recommend the following method:

1. Mention a feature that you currently have, but which is no longer serving you or which doesn't work the way you wanted it to.
		- If it's a new feature that you'd like to earn, especially because of a broken [[Creeds|Creed]], then mention that instead and why you think you deserve it.
2. Go around the table and write down a suggested alternative to that feature from each of your [[Peers]], including your [[Facilitator|FC]]. Then make a suggestion for yourself and write that down too.
		- These suggestions don't have to be of the same 'type' as the original, though they usually are.
			- That is, a specialty doesn't have to replaced with another specialty, it could be replaced with a condition or a gambit or possibly even an asset.
3. Have a think about the options that have now been written on the list, and discuss any of the ones you don't understand: What they would do, or why they were suggested.
4. Go through the list and make an quick pitch ‚Äî up to a minute each ‚Äî to your Peers as to why you think each feature would work for you.
		- If any given suggestion doesn't speak to you then you may skip it, effectively vetoing it.
5. Your Peers then vote on each suggestion that you made a pitch for: Giving a 'yes' üóπ in agreement or otherwise abstaining from voting on that particular feature if they disagree.
6. After voting, the suggested feature with the most 'yeses' is the one that you earn &or replace on your character sheet.
		- If there's a tie then you may break that tie with your vote and choose whichever one you prefer.
		- If no feature got any votes, or if no alternatives were suggested, then the feature is simply removed with no replacement.

> ### Nb.
>
> The suggested features and the following discussions should always be based on how you've played and portrayed your character _so far_ during the previous arc's sessions. The feature that wins a vote should feel like a reaction, not a promise.

You can repeat this process as many times as you like for each [[Player Characters|Player Character]] during a development session, but a _soft limit_ should be about once or twice per player each [[Campaign Arcs|arc]].

### Changing Tier

Changing your character's [[Tier]] is a big event. **This is a great milestone award, and not one that should be bestowed lightly, since it can supersede the entire [[Fidelity]] cycle.** However, if your character has done something suitably epic, or attained the blessing of a greater being, and _if all [[Peers]] are agreed_, then you may advance your [[Tier]].

![[Tier Benefits]]

The effects of advancing your Tier mean that you must choose a new [[Rank|ability rank]] array from the [[Tier Benefits|Tier benefits table]] (above). **You may advance as many ability ranks as is needed to meet the sum total of the next Tier.**

> ### Eg.
>
> If you started at Heroic Tier, and your current sum total is 23, from playing a few [[Campaign Arcs|arcs]] and advancing one rank naturally. Then when you receive your Tier advancement: Your sum total will reduce to 21, bringing you up to Legendary Tier, and you can advance two more ability ranks for free.

‚ùó You do not gain any bonus [[Character Assembly#4 Character Assembly Points|caps]] from advancing Tier, since you will have more than likely filled or exceeded the difference through play ‚Äî prior to advancing your Tier.

‚ùì You could also choose to regress your Tier, _by removing rank advancements_, if you feel it's appropriate, or if you feel the game has become to easy at the higher Tiers. It might be better to just [[Character Assembly|make a new character]] at a lower Tier instead though.
