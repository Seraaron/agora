# Development Sessions

A development session or ('dev session' for short) is the collective term for any type of [[Session Structure|game session]] that mainly involves out-of-game discussions between [[Peers]], rather than primarily involving interactions between in game characters.

**A dev session presents an opportunity for you to make big decisions about the game and the direction of the campaign**. Anyone can call for a development session at any time, but they are usually called for by the FC, and there is always a development session at the beginning of a new campaign â€” sometimes called the '**[[#The First Dev Session|session zero]]**'.

## The First Dev Session

This is your pre-game development session (alternatively called a 'zeroth session') that the FC uses to [[Pitching and Planning|pitch and prepare]] the game world and which players use to [[Character Assembly|create their characters]]. It's also when you should introduce your [[Script Change Tools|consent and safety tools]], and set up a schedule for the game to make sure that everyone knows when to play (and how many sessions the campaign is expected to last).

There's a lot to cover in this first dev session, **it can take a few hours to go through the following list thoroughly**, and you may even find that it takes multiple dev sessions before you *really* start playing. **This is ok**, especially for newer groups. For long-standing groups going through theses steps will usually go a lot quicker; but they should still be covered, even if only briefly.

![[Session Zero Checklist]]

#que Session zeroes aren't required for [[Pitching and Planning#One-shot Sessions|one-shot sessions]] or [[Pitching and Planning#Stand-alone Scenarios|stand-alone scenarios]] but you should still brief the players on the game before you hand out character sheets and start playing. 

## Later Dev Sessions

After you begin playing your characters and really start to dig into playing a campaign, it's a good idea to plan to run an extra development session between every [[Campaign Arcs|arc]], even if no one specifically asked for one.

#que One dev session every 10-20 sessions is a good rate, but you may find you need to use them more or less frequently, depending on your preferred pace.

**These later dev sessions can be used to achieve several things at once:**

- Debriefing the players on the previous play sessions since the last dev session, reviewing their [[Principles]], and potentially earning [[Fidelity]].
- Catching-up on other character developments, like taking new assets, checking-in with relationships, and [[#Peer Votes|conducting votes]] to earn new features.
- Opening the floor to give feedback and voice opinions about where to take the game next (in broad strokes).
- General [[Taking notes|book-keeping and note sharing]].
- Any other maintenance or upkeep that needs tending to, like shifting the game schedule or changing player roles.

### Democratic Character Development

Once you have [[Character Assembly|made characters]] and begun playing the game properly, you may begin to wonder how to increase certain stats on your sheet. **So here's a list of all the methods available to you to add and remove stuff from your character as they change and grow:**

- Earn [[Lots]] and [[Ego]] by engaging with your [[Principles]], pushing your [[agenda]],  and more generally by mastering the mechanics and roleplaying well.
- Earn [[Fidelity]] from your [[Creeds]] to eventually increase ability [[Rank|ranks]].
- Regain [[Health]] by changing your mind, and breaking an oath or abandoning a belief.
- Rederive your [[Capabilities|capabilities]] by going through the questions again and seeing if any of your answers have changed, or swap out for new capabilities if your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone or theme]] has changed.
- Gain '[[Earning Experience|exp]]' and level up your [[Jobs]] by failing Tasks with that Job, spending Lots on Task rolls while [[KISSing]], by earning an excess of [[Lots]], or simply as a generic reward from your [[Facilitator|FC]].
- Earn new specialties or gambits as rewards from your [[Facilitator|FC]] for completing a [[Goals|Goal]] or keeping a [[Habits|Habit]] for a long time.
- Change your [[VINPCs|Kith or Kin]], if you feel they are no longer important to the game (or if other characters have shown up that are more important), by asking your [[Peers]] if it's okay to do so at this time â€” in case any of them had plans for that VINPC.
- Acquire [[Assets and Gear|assets]] from advancing in your society, gain [[Assets and Gear#Prestigious Assets|prestige]] by doing great things.
- Pick up new [[Gear Examples List|bits of gear]] by spending money or resources, as gifts from [[Non-player Characters|NPCs]], or by looting and plundering the people or locations you visit.
- Gain, change, or remove any of your features â€” circumstances / traits, specialties, conditions, assets, or gambits â€” with a vote, conducted by your Peers ([[#Peer Votes|see below]]). 
- Get new conditions from [[Wounds and Scars|scars]] after [[Health|getting injured]]. 

Whenever any of these things happen, it's a good idea to notify your [[Peers]] if they're not already involved in the conversation, so that you can all help to keep each other accountable.

### Changing Features
There is any number of ways that you can conduct a [[Peers#Peer Votes|Peer vote]], but when it comes to changing old features â€” circumstances or traits, specialties, conditions, assets, or gambits â€” or earning new ones, we recommend the following method:

1. Mention a feature that you currently have, but which is no longer serving you or which doesn't work the way you wanted it to.
	- If it's a new feature that you'd like to earn, then mention that instead and why you think you deserve it.
2. Go around the table and write down a suggested alternative to that feature from each of your [[Peers]], including your [[Facilitator|FC]], and then make a suggestion for yourself (if you haven't already) and write that down too. 
	- These suggestions don't have to be of the same 'type' as the original, though they usually are.
	- That is, a specialty doesn't have to replaced with another specialty, it could be replaced with a condition or a gambit or possibly even an asset.
3. Have a think about the options that have now been written on the list, and discuss any of the ones you don't understand, what they would do, or why they were suggested.
4. Go through the list and make an quick pitch â€” about a minute each â€” to your Peers as to why you think each feature would work for you.
	- If any given suggestion doesn't speak to you then you may skip it, effectively vetoing it.
4. Your Peers then vote on each suggestion that you made a pitch for: Giving a 'yes' ðŸ—¹ in agreement or otherwise abstaining from voting on that particular feature if they disagree. (You don't get to vote yourself, you're the tie breaker).
5. After voting, the suggested feature with the most 'yeses' is the one that you earn &or replace on your character sheet.
	- If there's a tie then you may break that tie and choose whichever one you prefer.
	- If no feature got any votes, or if no alternatives were suggested, then the feature is simply removed with no replacement.

>#nb
>The suggested features and the following discussions should always be based on how you've played and portrayed your character *so far* during the previous arc's sessions. The feature that wins a vote should feel like a reaction, not a promise. 

You can repeat this process as many times as you like for each [[Player Characters|Player Character]] during a development session, but a *soft limit* should be about once or twice per player each [[Campaign Arcs|arc]].
