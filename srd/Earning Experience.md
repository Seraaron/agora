### Earning Experience

There are _three main ways_ to attain experience points (or 'exp' for short), representing your increasing technical knowledge, confidence, and general savviness, or good fortune:

- **When you perform a [[Tasks|Task]]** — you will earn 1 exp from a successful roll, or 2 exp from a failed roll. _This represents trying to learn from your mistakes._
- **When you spend [[Lots]] to create _practice scenes_ during [[Downtime and Travel*|downtime]]** — or **if you ever _exceed eight Lots_ total at the [[End-of-Session Lot Rewards|end of a session]]**, they will convert 1:1 into any job you like. _This represents an investment of fate into your chosen destiny._
- **When you learn something new** — after making a _critical roll_, or completing a relevant story moment, or when another character teaches you something (usually awarded by your [[Facilitator|FC]]). _This literally just represents learning stuff you didn't know before_.

Each time you earn exp, _fill in a single diamond beneath that job's name on your character sheet_ (ie. ◇◇ → ◆◇  or ◆◇ → ◆◆). So there's a little bit of book-keeping to track while playing the game.

❗ **You can usually only gain a maximum of 2 exp per job _per scene_**. One exception is the +MD [[Experience from Conflict|bonus exp from conflicts]], and the [[Facilitator|FC]] may make other exceptions too.

#### Leveling Up

**When you attain experience points equal to _twice the current level_ for a [[Jobs|job]]**, then clean the filled exp bar and **permanently raise the job level by +1**.

At first you will seem to level up quickly, but then it will take longer and longer until you plateau.

❓ The exp diamonds are presented in pairs to help you count out the right amount of exp for each level.

| Current level | Exp required to +1 | Bar appearance, when filled |
| :-----------: | :----------------: | :-------------------------: |
|     **1**     |          2         |      ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **2**     |          4         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **3**     |          6         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **4**     |          8         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **5**     |         10         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇      |
|     **6**     |         12         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆      |

**Note:** Level 6 is the nominal maximum level, but you can go beyond it by filling the exp bar and then receiving special training. These are called '[[Jobs#Master Levels|Master Levels]]'.
