### Earning Experience

There are _three main ways_ to attain experience points (or 'exp' for short), representing your increasing technical knowledge, confidence, and general savviness, or good fortunA e:

- **When you fail a [[Tasks|Task]]** — by not getting enough successes to overcome the number of factors against you. _This represents trying to learn from your mistakes._
- **Once per Task, if you spend a [[Lots|Lot]] to [[KISSing|KISS]]** — or if you ever exceed eight Lots total at the end of a session. _This represents an investment of fate into your chosen destiny._
- **When you learn something new** — after making a critical roll, or completing a relevant story moment, or when an [[Non-player Characters|NPC]] teaches you something; usually awarded by your [[Facilitator|FC]]. _This literally just represents learning stuff you didn't know before_.

Each time you earn exp, _fill in a single diamond beneath that job's name on your character sheet_ (ie. ◇◇ → ◆◇  or ◆◇ → ◆◆). So there's a little bit of book-keeping to track while playing the game, but it _drastically increases_ the general sense of progression.

The other way to earn exp is during [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]], by creating relevant scenes to show what you've been up to. _The longer the time skip, the more exp you can earn_.

#### Leveling Up

**When you attain experience points equal to _twice the current level_ for a [[Jobs|job]]**, then clean the filled exp bar and permanently **raise the job level by +1**.

At first you will seem to level up quickly, but then it will take longer and longer until you plateau.

#question The exp diamonds are presented in pairs to help you count out the right amount of exp for each level.

| Current level | Exp required to +1 | Bar appearance, when filled |
| :-----------: | :----------------: | :-------------------------: |
|     **1**     |          2         |      ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **2**     |          4         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **3**     |          6         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **4**     |          8         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇ ◇◇      |
|     **5**     |         10         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◇◇      |
|     **6***    |         12         |      ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆ ◆◆      |

#asterisk Level 6 is the nominal maximum level, but you can go beyond it by filling the exp bar and then receiving special training. These are called '[[Jobs#Master Levels|Master Levels]]'.

#### Zero Dice?

If you are reduced to zero dice to roll on a [[Tasks|Task]] — either due to [[Stress|stress]] or some other reason — you will **automatically fail** it, but you gain a point of _exp_. Or _with the aid of a [[KISSing#Stunts|stunt]] and the FCs approval_ you may roll a single [[Exploding Dice]] instead.
