# Kismet


In [[Agora]], kismet functions as a so-called 'metacurrency' — or narrative reward points — used to aid rolls and to track long-term character development.

There are four kinds of kismet: **[[Lots]]**, **[[Ego]]**, **[[Fidelity]]**, and **[[Health]]**. **You earn them mainly by roleplaying**, and you spend them to [[KISSing|KISS dice]], and to eventually advance your ability [[Rank|ranks]], or to avoid certain death.

> ### Nb.
> 'Kismet' is a Turkish word, derived from the Arabic **قسمة** 'qisma', meaning one's _"share in destiny"_.
