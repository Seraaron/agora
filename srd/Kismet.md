# Kismet

> #nb
> 'Kismet' is a Turkish word, derived from the Arabic **قسمة** 'qisma', meaning one's _share in destiny_.

In [[Agora]], kismet functions as a so-called 'metacurrency' — or narrative reward points — used to aid rolls and to track long-term character development.

There are four kinds of kismet: **[[Lots]]**, **[[Ego]]**, **[[Fidelity]]**, and **[[Health]]**. You earn them mainly by roleplaying, and you spend them to [[KISSing|KISS dice]], to eventually advance your ability [[Rank|ranks]], or to avoid certain death.
