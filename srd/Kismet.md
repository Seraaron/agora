# Kismet

> ### Nb.
> 'Kismet' is a Turkish word, derived from the Arabic **قسمة** 'qisma', meaning one's _share in destiny_.

In [[Agora]], kismet functions as a so-called 'metacurrency' — or narrative reward points — used to aid rolls and to track long-term character development.

There are four kinds of kismet: **[[Lots]]**, **[[Ego]]**, **[[Fidelity]]**, and **[[Health]]**. **You earn them mainly by roleplaying**, and you spend them to [[KISSing|KISS dice]], to eventually advance your ability [[Rank|ranks]], or to avoid certain death.

###### Changing the Gauge?

With the Fidelity gauge's default size set to four, that means that you must acquire 12 Fidelity to take _one ability_ from rank 5 to rank 2, which assuming you earn about 1 Fidelity every 10 sessions would take at least 100 sessions! This sounds like a lot, _and it is_, but this slow kind of character progression forms a 'supercycle' that encapsulates all the other progression cycles in [[Agora]].

Shortening (or lengthening?) the Fidelity gauge will drastically change your long-term experience with the game, so this _must absolutely be discussed_ with your [[Peers]] if you're considering it.
