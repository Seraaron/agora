# Circumstances

Circumstances are the parts of your character that make them _yours_. They are mostly just a collection of words and phrases, but they encapsulate a lot of personal meaning. They are the first thing you see on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]], and they should always help to guide you back into character while roleplaying, [[Agenda|to find your agenda]], or to remind you of who you're playing if there's been a long break between sessions.

## Types of Circumstance

There are eight spaces to fill in with descriptive information about your character:

| Group                      | Subgroup                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **[[#Name]]**              | **[[#Aliases or Titles]]** |
| **[[#Archetypes]]**        | _Optional:_ **[[Wealth]]** |
| **[[#Background Traits]]** | **[[Size]]**              |
| **[[#Foreground Traits]]** | **[[Age]]**               |

### Name

This is simply your most preferred or most publicly known identifying proper noun (and your respective pronouns).

**In other words:** _This is just what everyone calls you_.

Choose a name that means something symbolic to you, or which means something in your culture's native language, or randomly generate one.

❓ Choosing names can be hard, and sometimes you find that a name no longer suits you. That's perfectly fine. You can change your identity at any time, simply by mentioning it to your [[Peers]], then erasing and replacing it on your sheet.

#### Aliases or Titles

These are your alternate names, pseudonyms, &or family names, or perhaps even your _true name_. You can also include specific titles or honorifics that have been bestowed onto you here, though you will need to represent them again using [[Assets and Gear#Prestige|assets]] to leverage any mechanical advantage from them.

### Archetypes

[[Character Assembly#2 Archetypes|Archetypes]] are a type of 'loadout' which you choose from a few lists during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]]. They define your character's species or ancestry, their cultural or geographic origin, and their most recent profession, or what they've spent most of their life training to do best.

This choice grants them most of their starting [[Jobs|job levels]], some [[Specialties|specialties]], [[Assets and Gear|assets or gear]], and sometimes a unique [[Gambits|gambit]], [[Conditions|condition]], or some [[Spellcasting|spells]] — as well as their starting [[Wealth]].

Taking an archetype doesn't exclude you from taking other jobs or specialties later on. Think of them like templates, or scaffolding, that's done most of the ground work but leaves some blanks for you to fill in.

> ### Eg.
> 
> You need to list your choice of archetypes on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]] for bookkeeping purposes, but you can personalize them quite a bit.
> - Instead of just flatly listing *"Human (species), Imperial (culture), Sentinel (profession)"* you could write *"Ōuchi Clan Samurai"*, if you were playing in a historical setting (ie. In the Japanese [Segoku Jidai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_period)).
> - Instead of *"Elf, Pillar, Duelist"* you could write *"Elven Escorte de la Philosophie de L'étude du Couteau"*, whatever that means…?
> 
> In many ways, the way you write your archetypes can strongly reflect your original [[Character Assembly#1 Concept Concept Concept|character concept]] or add flavor to the world you're playing in.

### Traits

#### Background Traits

These traits represent the _most important_ parts of your character's physical, personal, biological, or cognitive make-up. They are the things that you probably had very little control over growing up, but which have nonetheless shaped you into who you are today.

> ##### Background Suggestions:
>
> - Lineage, pedigree, clan, or dynasty
> - Religion, heritage, or ethnic roots
> - Sexuality or gender identity
> - Relative height or weight
> - Hair, eyes, and skin colors or patterns
> - Social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> - Personality traits or special mannerisms
> - Common features (similarities to the norm)

The important thing to know about background traits is that _you should only need to add the things that are most fundamental to you:_ Something that you want to make relevant to the game, but which you don't think are likely to ever change during play, and which you don't ever want to be brought into question. By putting a trait in your background, you're making a statement about yourself.

###### Background vs. Foreground

You may notice some _repeated entries_ between the suggested foreground and background traits, and that's because your traits are personal to _you_.

**The difference between the background and foreground is in how open the trait is to being challenged or changed.** Background traits cannot be interrogated or questioned by your [[Peers]], whereas foreground traits _can_. So you may share some traits with another character, for example, but simply prioritize them differently.

In truth, there is no mechanical difference between the two sets of traits — just their narrative placement in the landscape of your self-identity. Ultimately, these traits function mainly as _guideposts to help you recenter your character_, or to help you [[Agenda|find your agenda]]; but they can also earn you [[Lots]].

---

#### Foreground Traits

These are mostly cosmetic, expressive, societal, or personality traits. They represent the parts of your self that you actively try to present to others, that you take pride in, or that you flaunt. They generally make your characters life _more interesting_, and make them more fun for you to play as them.

> ##### Foreground Suggestions:
>
> - Your social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> - Physique, build, and diet
> - Sexuality or gender identity
> - Style, colors, and appearance
> - Personality traits or special mannerisms
> - Tattoos, piercings, scars, or body modifications
> - Divergent features (differences from the norm)

The important thing to know about putting a trait in the foreground is that _you're stating that it is something that you think is possible to alter over time:_ Something that could either become fundamentally important to you over time and eventually get moved into the background, which could slowly become less and less relevant until it's removed entirely, or something which might just stay where it is but always gets noticed. By putting a trait in your foreground, you're making a statement about yourself.

❓ Foreground traits may also be old [[Conditions|conditions]] that you have finally learned how to deal with, or, at least, which you can move on from and no longer wish to use — via '[[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]'.

###### Cosmetic & Cultural Expressions

Your character comes from a culture that undoubtedly looks different from the many other peoples across the world, and those people will think different things about what they consider beautiful or ugly. Some characters have also traveled to other nations, planets, or dimensions, too, and changed themselves to try to fit in. Some reject their heritage entirely, and try to define themselves on their own terms.

What does your culture value that differs from your own values? How do you make yourself appear attractive or desirable to people of your own culture, or to others? What parts of your self do you flaunt? Or do you try to avoid attention, and how, if so? How do you look despite how you want to be perceived? What parts of your self cannot (or should not) be hidden?

Answers to these questions can all serve as background or foregound traits.

## Using Circumstances

Beyond providing a means for players to express themselves and create the characters they're imagining with only a handful of words, all Circumstances — _but especially your background and foreground traits_ — can earn you a [[Kismet#Lots|Lot]] by representing them at the table:

**When your Circumstances drive play, or when you _play them earnestly and respectfully_, through roleplay, showing off, or expressing the trait at the right time to get what you want.** You may be rewarded with a [[Lots|Lot]] at [[End-of-Session Lot Rewards|the end of each session]], so make a note when these moments occur.

❗ Circumstances can also affect what kinds of people you may reasonably know if you're using the [[Capabilities#Links|Links capabaility]].

## Making-up Circumstances

Since circumstances are just evocative words and phrases, it's quite easy to come up with new ones.

> ### Eg.
>
> They can be as broad and wide-reaching as "Undead" — which would imply, for example, that undead creatures are _sapient and playable_ in your world — or as narrow and specific as "West-islander tattoos (spiral patterns)" or "Missing tooth (upper-left canine)".

**There's an infinity of options**, but don't be overwhelmed! As mentioned, the key is to _only include the really important things_, or in other words _the things that you want to be most-relevant to the game_.

### How many?

There's technically no limit on how many circumstances a character can have, but you'll more than likely run out of space on the [[Character Resources|character sheet]] before you run out of ideas. This is a good _natural limit_, as the constraint forces you to be reserved about your choices.

However, it may also depend on the _expected length_ of your campaign. If you play the same character for long enough, you'll find yourself running out of space a lot quicker. Therefore, [multi-page character sheets](#charsheet) are also provided that give you a lot more space to flesh out your character.
