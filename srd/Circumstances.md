# Circumstances

Circumstances are the parts of your character that make them _yours_. They are just simple words and phrases, but they encapsulate a lot of personal meaning. They are the first thing you see on your [character sheet](#charsheet), and they should always help to guide you back into character while roleplaying, [[Agenda|find your agenda]], or remind you of who you're playing if there's been a long break between sessions.

## Types of Circumstance

There are seven spaces to provide information about your character:

- **[[#Name (and Pronouns)]]** and **[[#Aliases or Titles]]**
- **[[#Background Traits]]** and **[[#Size]]**
- **[[#Foreground Traits]]** and **[[#Age]]**
- **[[#Walks of Life]]**

### Name (and Pronouns)

This is simply your most preferred or most publicly known identifying proper noun and respective pronouns. In other words, _this is just what everyone calls you_.

Choose a name that means something to you, or which means something in your culture's native language, or just randomly generate one.

Choosing names can be hard, and sometimes you find that a name no longer suits you. That's perfectly fine. You can change your identity at any time simply, by mentioning it to your [[Peers]], then erasing and replacing it on your sheet.

#### Aliases or Titles

These are your alternate names, pseudonyms, and/or family names, or perhaps even your _true name_. You can also include specific titles or honorifics that have been bestowed onto you here, though you will need to represent them again using a [[Assets and Gear#Prestigious Assets|prestigious asset]] to leverage any mechanical advantage from them.

### Background Traits

These traits represent the _most important_ parts of your character's physical, personal, biological, or cognitive make-up. They are the things that you probably had very little control over growing up, but which have nonetheless shaped you into who you are today.

> ##### Background Trait Suggestions:
>
> - Your species, stock, or ancestry
> - Lineage, pedigree, clan, or dynasty
> - Culture, religion, or ethnic roots
> - Sexuality or gender identity
> - Relative height or weight
> - Hair, eyes, and skin colors or patterns
> - Social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> - Personality traits or special mannerisms
> - Natural or divergent features

The important thing to know about background traits is that _you should only need to add the things that are most fundamental to you:_ Something that you want to make relevant to the game, but which you don't think are likely to ever change during play, and which you don't ever want to be brought into question. By putting a trait in your background, you're making a statement about yourself.

> #eg
> There's no point in writing 'human' into your traits if everyone else in the game's setting is also a human. So you only need to declare things that the highlight your differences from others around you, and only if you _want_ those differences to be made important.

#### Size

Size is a special background trait that gets its own box to write in, because it's unlikely to ever meaningfully change during play once you're an adult, and because it has a small mechanical effect.

Typically determined by genetics, diet, and age; size represents an _approximate combination_ of your physical dimensions and mass:

| Playable Adult Sizes | _Approx. Height_        | _Approx. Weight_              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1.  **Small:**       | _~2-5 ft (90-150 cm)_   | _Less than a quintal_         |
| 2.  **Modest:**      | _~5-6 ft (150-180 cm)_  | _~90-250 lbs (40-110 kg)_     |
| 3.  **Ample:**       | _~6-7 ft (180-210 cm)_  | _~250-2200 lbs (110-1000 kg)_ |
| 4.  **Large:**       | _~7-10 ft (210-300 cm)_ | _More than a tonne_           |

#que Most adult humans will either be considered 'Small' or 'Modest' under these definitions.

#imp It is not possible to play as 'smaller than small' or 'larger than large' characters without your [[Facilitator|FC's]] permission, as these may simply be impractical.

##### Size _Does_ Matter (sometimes)

When there is a difference in size brackets between you and another character — and your [[Facilitator|FC]] determines that this difference should be _mechanically represented_ during a roll — then either a bonus die or a penalty factor may be added, depending on the context of the action.

> #eg
> A larger character attempting to wrestle with a smaller character may be given a bonus die, but if the opponent is _significantly_ smaller than the larger one then they may be given a penalty instead.

### Foreground Traits

These are mostly cosmetic, expressive, societal, or personality traits. They represent the parts of your self that you actively try to present to others, that you take pride in, or that you flaunt. They generally make your characters life _more interesting_, and make them more fun for you to play as them.

> ##### Foreground Trait Suggestions:
>
> - Your social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> - Physique, build, and diet
> - Sexuality or gender identity
> - Style, colors, and appearance
> - Personality traits or special mannerisms
> - Tattoos, piercings, scars, or body modifications
> - Natural or divergent features

Foreground traits may also be old [[Conditions|conditions]] that you have finally learned how to deal with, or, at least, which you can move on from and no longer wish to use (via '[[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]').

The important thing to know about putting a trait in the foreground is that _you're stating that it is something that you think is possible to alter over time:_ Something that could either become fundamentally important to you over time and eventually get moved into the background, which could slowly become less and less relevant until it's removed entirely, or something which might just stay where it is but always gets noticed. By putting a trait in your foreground, you're making a statement about yourself.

###### Background vs. Foreground

You may have noticed some _repeated entries_ between the suggested foreground and background traits, and that's because your traits are personal to _you_.

**The difference between the background and foreground is in how open the trait is to being challenged or changed.** Background traits cannot be interrogated or questioned by your [[Peers]], whereas foreground traits _can_. So you may share some traits with another character, for example, but simply prioritize them differently.

In truth, then, there is no mechanical difference between the two sets of traits; just their narrative placement in the landscape of your self-identity. Ultimately, these traits function mainly as _guideposts to help you recenter character_, or to help you [[Agenda|find your agenda]].

---

#### Age

Age is a special foreground trait that gets its own box to write in, because age can change over extended periods of time, and because it has a small mechanical effect.

Typically determined by how long you've been alive; age represents the stage of adulthood you're currently at for your species.

Ages come in four brackets for playable adult characters (with approximate human-aged equivalents for reference), and **your choice affects which [[Rank|ability ranks]] you may freely advance during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]]**:

| Playable Adult Ages | _Years Old_ | Ment. Rank Bonus  | Phys. Rank Bonus  |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 1. **Young:**       | _~18-25_    | #up **1M**        | #up **3P**        |
| 2. **Seasoned:**    | _~25-40_    | #up **4M/P** ≤ 2* | #up **4M/P** ≤ 2* |
| 3. **Mature:**      | _~40-60_    | #up **2M**        | #up **2P**        |
| 4. **Old:**         | _~60-90_    | #up **3M**        | #up **1P**        |

#ast Seasoned characters have 4 total rank bonuses to _distribute between [[Abilities#Mental Abilities|Mental]] or [[Abilities#Physical Abilities|Physical]] abilities_, but no one ability may be advanced more than twice.

#imp It is not possible to play as junior or senior characters without your [[Peers|Peer's]] permission, as they are more vulnerable and are likely to be difficult to roleplay respectfully (or may simply make other players uncomfortable, depending on your game's [[Genre, tone, and themes|tone]]).

### Walks of Life

Walks of life (or 'WoLs' for short) describe your work history, important life events, and personal stories in summary. They may be literal vocations or occupational titles; or periods of studentship, service, incarceration, or exile; snippets from your upbringing; archetypal party roles or 'adventuring classes'; or simply evocative keywords.

During [[Character Assembly|character assembly]], each walk of life gives you three [[Jobs|jobs]], a random feature (ie. a [[Conditions|condition]], [[Specialties|specialty]] or [[Gambits|gambit]]), and any required [[Assets and Gear|assets or gear]].

If you are using [[playbooks]] and the [[quick start rules]] then you'll be offered a shortlist of walks of life to choose from. If you're going through the full character assembly process then you'll be able to pick and choose _any_ walks of life from a [[Walks of Life|big list]], or even [[#Making up Traits and Walks from scratch|make up your own]].

## Using Circumstances

Beyond providing a means for players to express themselves and create the characters they're imagining with only a handful of words, all Circumstances — _but especially your background and foreground traits_ — can earn you [[Kismet#Lots|Lots]] by representing them at the table:

- **When you show pride in a Circumstance, or _play it earnestly in the moment_, by roleplaying, showing off, or expressing the trait at the right time to get what you want.**
- You get the reward as soon as this _leads to a new situation_ that wouldn't have otherwise happened, or if the roleplaying _avoids a roll entirely_ that would have ordinarily been necessary.

#imp Circumstances can also affect what kinds of people you may reasonably know if you're using the [[Capabilities#Links|Links capabaility]].

## Making-up Circumstances

Since circumstances are just evocative words and phrases, it's quite easy to come up with new ones. They can be as broad and wide-reaching as "Alive" or "Human", or as narrow and specific as "West-islander tattoos (spiral patterns)" or "Missing tooth (upper-left canine)". **There's an infinity of options**. As mentioned, the key is to _only include the really important things_, or in other words _the things that you want to be relevant to the game_.

### Vanity Features

Additionally, any 'feature' in the game — ie. conditions, specialties, gambits, and even assets or gear — can be written as a circumstance. By doing this you are saying that it's important to your _character's personality_, but that you don't care about the mechanical effects of the feature itself.

### How many?

There's technically no limit on how many circumstances or features a character can have, but you'll more than likely run out of character sheet space before you run out of ideas. This is a good _natural limit_, as the constraint forces you to be reserved about your choices.

However, it may also depend on the _expected length_ of your campaign. If you play the same character for long enough, you'll find yourself running out of space a lot quicker. Therefore, [multi-page character sheets](#charsheet) are also provided that give you a lot more space to flesh out your character.

###### Cosmetic Expressions

Your character comes from a culture that undoubtedly looks different from many others in the world, and your people will think different things about what they consider beautiful or desirable. Some characters have also traveled to other nations too, and changed themselves to try to fit in.

What does your culture value that differs from your own values? How do you make yourself appear beautiful or desirable to people of your own culture, or to others? What parts of your self do you flaunt? Or do you try to avoid attention, and how, if so? How do you look despite how you want to be perceived? What parts of your self cannot (or should not) be hidden?
