# Circumstances

Circumstances are the parts of your character that make them *yours*. They are mostly just a collection of words and phrases, but they encapsulate a lot of personal meaning. They are the first thing you see on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], and they should always help to guide you back into character while roleplaying, [[Agenda|to find your agenda]], or to remind you of who you're playing if there's been a long break between sessions.

## Types of Circumstance

There are nine spaces to fill in with descriptive information about your character:

| Group                       |  Subgroup                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **[[#Name]]**              | **[[#Aliases or Titles]]** |
| **[[#Class & Culture]]**     | **[[#Wealth]]**            |
| **[[#Backgrounds]]**       | **[[#Size]]**              |
| **[[#Foregrounds]]**       | **[[#Age]]**               |
| **[[Exclusive Features]]** |  **[[Minor Features]]**?                    |

### Name

This is simply your most preferred or most publicly known identifying proper noun (and your respective pronouns). In other words, *this is just what everyone calls you*.

Choose a name that means something symbolic to you, or which means something in your culture's native language, or just randomly generate one.

Choosing names can be hard, and sometimes you find that a name no longer suits you. That's perfectly fine. You can change your identity at any time simply, by mentioning it to your [[Peers]], then erasing and replacing it on your sheet.

#### Aliases or Titles

These are your alternate names, pseudonyms, and/or family names, or perhaps even your _true name_. You can also include specific titles or honorifics that have been bestowed onto you here, though you will need to represent them again using a [[Assets and Gear#Prestige|prestigious asset]] to leverage any mechanical advantage from them.

### Class & Culture

#### Wealth

### Backgrounds

These traits represent the *most important* parts of your character's physical, personal, biological, or cognitive make-up. They are the things that you probably had very little control over growing up, but which have nonetheless shaped you into who you are today.

> ##### Background Trait Suggestions:
>
> -   Your species, clade, or ancestry
> -   Lineage, pedigree, clan, or dynasty
> -   Culture, religion, or ethnic roots
> -   Sexuality or gender identity
> -   Relative height or weight
> -   Hair, eyes, and skin colors or patterns
> -   Social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> -   Personality traits or special mannerisms
> -   Natural or divergent features

The important thing to know about background traits is that *you should only need to add the things that are most fundamental to you:* Something that you want to make relevant to the game, but which you don't think are likely to ever change during play, and which you don't ever want to be brought into question. By putting a trait in your background, you're making a statement about yourself.

> #eg
> There's no point in writing 'human' into your traits if everyone else in the game's setting is also a human. So you only need to declare things that the highlight your differences from others around you, and only if you *want* those differences to be made important.

#### Size

Size is a special background trait because it's unlikely to ever meaningfully change during play once you're an adult, and because it has a small mechanical effect. Typically determined by genetics, diet, and age; size represents an *approximate combination* of your physical dimensions and mass:

|    | Playable Adult Sizes | *Approx. Height*        | *Approx. Weight*              |
| -: | ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1. | **Small:**  | *~2-5 ft (90-150 cm)*   | *Less than a quintal*         |
| 2. | **Modest:** | *~5-6 ft (150-180 cm)*  | *~90-250 lbs (40-110 kg)*     |
| 3. | **Ample:**  | *~6-7 ft (180-210 cm)*  | *~250-2200 lbs (110-1000 kg)* |
| 4. | **Large:**  | *~7-10 ft (210-300 cm)* | *More than a tonne*           |

Most adult humans will either be considered 'Small' or 'Modest' under these definitions.

#imp It is not possible to play as 'smaller than small' or 'larger than large' characters without your [[Facilitator|FC's]] permission, as these may be simply impractical.

##### Size *Does* Matter (sometimes)

When there is a difference in sizes between you and another character — and your [[Facilitator|FC]] determines that this difference should be *mechanically represented* during a roll — then either a bonus die or a penalty factor may be added, depending on the context of the action.

> #eg
> A larger character attempting to wrestle with a smaller character may be given a bonus die, but if the opponent is *significantly* smaller than the larger one then they may be given a penalty instead.

Size also affects your [[Carry Weight]] limit, if you're using those rules.

### Foregrounds

These are mostly cosmetic, expressive, societal, or personality traits. They represent the parts of your self that you actively try to present to others, that you take pride in, or that you flaunt. They generally make your characters life *more interesting*, and make them more fun for you to play as them.

> ##### Foreground Trait Suggestions:
>
> -   Your social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> -   Physique, build, and diet
> -   Sexuality or gender identity
> -   Style, colors, and appearance
> -   Personality traits or special mannerisms
> -   Tattoos, piercings, scars, or body modifications
> -   Natural or divergent features

The important thing to know about putting a trait in the foreground is that *you're stating that it is something that you think is possible to alter over time:* Something that could either become fundamentally important to you over time and eventually get moved into the background, which could slowly become less and less relevant until it's removed entirely, or something which might just stay where it is but always gets noticed. By putting a trait in your foreground, you're making a statement about yourself.

#que Foreground traits may also be old [[Conditions|conditions]] that you have finally learned how to deal with, or, at least, which you can move on from and no longer wish to use — via '[[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]'.

###### Background vs. Foreground

You may have noticed some *repeated entries* between the suggested foreground and background traits, and that's because your traits are personal to *you*.

**The difference between the background and foreground is in how open the trait is to being challenged or changed.** Background traits cannot be interrogated or questioned by your [[Peers]], whereas foreground traits *can*. So you may share some traits with another character, for example, but simply prioritize them differently.

In truth, then, there is no mechanical difference between the two sets of traits; just their narrative placement in the landscape of your self-identity. Ultimately, these traits function mainly as *guideposts to help you recenter your character*, or to help you [[Agenda|find your agenda]].

#### Age

Age is a special foreground trait because age can change over extended periods of time, and because it has a small mechanical effect. Typically determined by how long you've been alive; age represents the stage of adulthood you're currently at for your species.

|    | Playable Adult Ages    | *Approx. Human Equivalent* | Bonus Job Levels | +Master Levels | Rank Penalties |
| -: | ------------- | :-------------------: | :--------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| 1. | **Young:**    |        *~18-25 yrs*       |         0        |       +0       |        —       |
| 2. | **Seasoned:** |        *~25-40 yrs*       |         5        |       +0       |       ↓1       |
| 3. | **Mature:**   |        *~40-60 yrs*       |         8        |       +1       |       ↓2       |
| 4. | **Old:**      |        *~60-90 yrs*       |        10        |       +2       |       ↓3       |

The older your character's starting age, the more bonus job levels you will gain — to distribute however you please — and at 'Mature' and 'Old' age you gain 1 or 2 '[[Jobs#Master Levels|master levels]]' which can take a job above level 6. But older characters also lose [[Rank|ranks]] in 1 to 3 of their abilities, regressing each by 1 step (ie. 3 → 4 → 5 → 6).

#imp It is not possible to play as child or an extremely elderly character without your [[Peers|Peer's]] permission, as they are more vulnerable and are likely to be difficult to roleplay respectfully, or may not suit your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]].

###### Cosmetic Expressions

Your character comes from a culture that undoubtedly looks different from many others in the world, and your people will think different things about what they consider beautiful or desirable. Some characters have also traveled to other nations, planets, or dimensions, too, and changed themselves to try to fit in.

What does your culture value that differs from your own values? How do you make yourself appear beautiful or desirable to people of your own culture, or to others? What parts of your self do you flaunt? Or do you try to avoid attention, and how, if so? How do you look despite how you want to be perceived? What parts of your self cannot (or should not) be hidden?

## Using Circumstances

Beyond providing a means for players to express themselves and create the characters they're imagining with only a handful of words, all Circumstances — *but especially your background and foreground traits* — can earn you a [[Kismet#Lots|Lot]] by representing them at the table:

**When your Circumstances drive play, or when you *play them earnestly and respectfully*, through roleplay, showing off, or expressing the trait at the right time to get what you want.** You get the reward at [[End-of-Session Rewards|the end of each session]], so make a note when these moments occur.

#imp Circumstances can also affect what kinds of people you may reasonably know if you're using the [[Capabilities#Links|Links capabaility]].

## Making-up Circumstances

Since circumstances are just evocative words and phrases, it's quite easy to come up with new ones. They can be as broad and wide-reaching as "Alive" or "Human", or as narrow and specific as "West-islander tattoos (spiral patterns)" or "Missing tooth (upper-left canine)". **There's an infinity of options**. As mentioned, the key is to *only include the really important things*, or in other words *the things that you want to be relevant to the game*.

### Vanity Features

Additionally, any 'feature' in the game — ie. conditions, specialties, gambits, and even assets or gear — can be written as a circumstance. By doing this you are saying that it's important to your *character's personality*, but that you don't care about the mechanical effects of the feature itself.

### How many?

There's technically no limit on how many circumstances or features a character can have, but you'll more than likely run out of space on the [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] before you run out of ideas. This is a good *natural limit*, as the constraint forces you to be reserved about your choices.

However, it may also depend on the *expected length* of your campaign. If you play the same character for long enough, you'll find yourself running out of space a lot quicker. Therefore, [multi-page character sheets](#charsheet) are also provided that give you a lot more space to flesh out your character.
