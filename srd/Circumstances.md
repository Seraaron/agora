# Circumstances

Circumstances are the parts of your character that make them _yours_. They are mostly just a collection of words and phrases, but they encapsulate a lot of personal meaning. They are the first thing you see on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], and they should always help to guide you back into character while roleplaying, [[Agenda|to find your agenda]], or to remind you of who you're playing if there's been a long break between sessions.

## Types of Circumstance

There are nine spaces to fill in with descriptive information about your character:

| Group                    | Subgroup                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **[[#Name]]**            | **[[#Aliases or Titles]]**    |
| **[[#Archetypes]]** | *Optional:* **[[Wealth]]** |
| **[[#Backgrounds]]**     | **[[#Size]]**                 |
| **[[#Foregrounds]]**     | **[[#Age]]**                  |

### Name

This is simply your most preferred or most publicly known identifying proper noun (and your respective pronouns). In other words, _this is just what everyone calls you_.

Choose a name that means something symbolic to you, or which means something in your culture's native language, or just randomly generate one.

Choosing names can be hard, and sometimes you find that a name no longer suits you. That's perfectly fine. You can change your identity at any time simply, by mentioning it to your [[Peers]], then erasing and replacing it on your sheet.

#### Aliases or Titles

These are your alternate names, pseudonyms, &or family names, or perhaps even your _true name_. You can also include specific titles or honorifics that have been bestowed onto you here, though you will need to represent them again using [[Assets and Gear#Prestige|assets]] to leverage any mechanical advantage from them.

### Archetypes

Archetypes are like 'loadouts', which you can choose during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]], that grant you a few starting [[Jobs|job levels]], a [[Specialties|specialties]] or two, and sometimes a unique [[Gambits|feature]] or special power.

An archetype doesn't exclude you from taking other jobs or specialties later on, they mainly exist just as a way to get you started with a character the suits your [[Character Assembly#1 Concept Concept Concept|concept]] more quickly. In fact, once you've made your character you can ignore your archetypes entirely for the rest of the game if you wish to — but they usually bring a bit of flavor, describe some implicit world-building, and help you to roleplay.

By default, you may choose three archetypes for your character: An **ancestry** or **species**, your **culture**, and a **class** or **vocation**. Which ones you choose, what your available choices are, and how important those decisions are will all depend on your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|genre, themes, and tone]] — so be sure to discuss it in [[Development Sessions|session zero]].

❓ Archetype are explained in more detail in the [[Character Assembly]] article, or you can jump straight to the [[Archtypes List]] and start browsing.

### Backgrounds

These traits represent the _most important_ parts of your character's physical, personal, biological, or cognitive make-up. They are the things that you probably had very little control over growing up, but which have nonetheless shaped you into who you are today.

> ##### Background Trait Suggestions:
>
> -   Your species, clade, or ancestry
> -   Lineage, pedigree, clan, or dynasty
> -   Culture, religion, or ethnic roots
> -   Sexuality or gender identity
> -   Relative height or weight
> -   Hair, eyes, and skin colors or patterns
> -   Social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> -   Personality traits or special mannerisms
> -   Natural or divergent features

The important thing to know about background traits is that _you should only need to add the things that are most fundamental to you:_ Something that you want to make relevant to the game, but which you don't think are likely to ever change during play, and which you don't ever want to be brought into question. By putting a trait in your background, you're making a statement about yourself.

> ### Eg.
> There's no point in writing 'human' into your traits if everyone else in the game's setting is also a human. So you only need to declare things that the highlight your differences from others around you, and only if you _want_ those differences to be made important.

#### Size

Size is a special background trait because it's unlikely to ever meaningfully change during play once you're an adult, and because it has a small mechanical effect. Typically determined by genetics, diet, and age. Size represents an _approximate combination_ of your physical dimensions and mass:

|    | Playable Adult Sizes | _Approx. Height_        | _Approx. Weight_              |
| -: | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1. | **Small:**           | _~3-5 ft (90-150 cm)_   | _Less than a quintal_         |
| 2. | **Modest:**          | _~5-6 ft (150-180 cm)_  | _~90-250 lbs (40-110 kg)_     |
| 3. | **Ample:**           | _~6-7 ft (180-210 cm)_  | _~250-2200 lbs (110-1000 kg)_ |
| 4. | **Large:**           | _~7-9 ft (210-275 cm)_ | _More than a tonne_           |

Most adult humans would be considered 'Modest' under these definitions.

❗ It is not possible to play as 'smaller than small' or 'larger than large' characters without your [[Facilitator|FC's]] permission, as these may be simply impractical.

##### Size _Does_ Matter (sometimes)

When there is a difference in sizes between you and another character — and your [[Facilitator|FC]] determines that this difference should be _mechanically represented_ during a roll — then either a bonus die or a difficulty factor may be added, depending on the context of the action.

> ### Eg.
> A larger character attempting to wrestle with a smaller character may be given a bonus die, but if the opponent is _significantly_ smaller than the larger one then they may be given a penalty instead.

❗ Size also affects your [[Carry Weight]] limit, if you're using those rules.

### Foregrounds

These are mostly cosmetic, expressive, societal, or personality traits. They represent the parts of your self that you actively try to present to others, that you take pride in, or that you flaunt. They generally make your characters life _more interesting_, and make them more fun for you to play as them.

> ##### Foreground Trait Suggestions:
>
> -   Your social class, feudal caste, or nationality
> -   Physique, build, and diet
> -   Sexuality or gender identity
> -   Style, colors, and appearance
> -   Personality traits or special mannerisms
> -   Tattoos, piercings, scars, or body modifications
> -   Natural or divergent features

The important thing to know about putting a trait in the foreground is that _you're stating that it is something that you think is possible to alter over time:_ Something that could either become fundamentally important to you over time and eventually get moved into the background, which could slowly become less and less relevant until it's removed entirely, or something which might just stay where it is but always gets noticed. By putting a trait in your foreground, you're making a statement about yourself.

❓ Foreground traits may also be old [[Conditions|conditions]] that you have finally learned how to deal with, or, at least, which you can move on from and no longer wish to use — via '[[Conditions#Catharsis|catharsis]]'.

###### Background vs. Foreground

You may have noticed some _repeated entries_ between the suggested foreground and background traits, and that's because your traits are personal to _you_.

**The difference between the background and foreground is in how open the trait is to being challenged or changed.** Background traits cannot be interrogated or questioned by your [[Peers]], whereas foreground traits _can_. So you may share some traits with another character, for example, but simply prioritize them differently.

In truth, there is no mechanical difference between the two sets of traits — just their narrative placement in the landscape of your self-identity. Ultimately, these traits function mainly as _guideposts to help you recenter your character_, or to help you [[Agenda|find your agenda]].

---

#### Age

Age is a special foreground trait because age can change over extended periods of time, and because it has a small mechanical effect. Typically determined by how long you've been alive, age represents the stage of adulthood you're currently at for your species.

|    | Playable Adult Ages | _Approx. Human Equivalent_ | Bonus Wealth | Master Levels | Max. Free Conditions |
| -: | ------------------- | :------------------------: | :----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: |
| 1. | **Young:**          |        _~18-25 yrs_        |      +0      |       1      |        3        |
| 2. | **Seasoned:**       |        _~25-40 yrs_        |      +1      |       2      |        4        |
| 3. | **Mature:**         |        _~40-60 yrs_        |      +2      |       3      |        5        |
| 4. | **Old:**            |        _~60-90 yrs_        |      +2      |       4      |        6        |

The older your character's starting age, the more starting [[#Wealth|wealth]] you get, and the more [[Jobs#Master Levels|master levels]] you can take. Older characters also typically have more starting [[Conditions|conditions]], though: Roll, or choose, 1-3 more times on the [[D666 Conditions|conditions list]].

❗ It is not possible to play as child or an extremely elderly character without your [[Peers|Peer's]] permission, as they are **capped at only one [[Health]]** — and they are likely to be more difficult to roleplay respectfully, or may not suit your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]].

###### Cosmetic Expressions

Your character comes from a culture that undoubtedly looks different from many others in the world, and your people will think different things about what they consider beautiful or desirable. Some characters have also traveled to other nations, planets, or dimensions, too, and changed themselves to try to fit in.

What does your culture value that differs from your own values? How do you make yourself appear beautiful or desirable to people of your own culture, or to others? What parts of your self do you flaunt? Or do you try to avoid attention, and how, if so? How do you look despite how you want to be perceived? What parts of your self cannot (or should not) be hidden?

## Using Circumstances

Beyond providing a means for players to express themselves and create the characters they're imagining with only a handful of words, all Circumstances — _but especially your background and foreground traits_ — can earn you a [[Kismet#Lots|Lot]] by representing them at the table:

**When your Circumstances drive play, or when you _play them earnestly and respectfully_, through roleplay, showing off, or expressing the trait at the right time to get what you want.** You may be rewarded with a [[Lots|Lot]] at [[End-of-Session Lot Rewards|the end of each session]], so make a note when these moments occur.

❗ Circumstances can also affect what kinds of people you may reasonably know if you're using the [[Capabilities#Links|Links capabaility]].

## Making-up Circumstances

Since circumstances are just evocative words and phrases, it's quite easy to come up with new ones.

> ### Eg.
> They can be as broad and wide-reaching as "Undead" — which would imply, for example, that undead creatures are *sapient and playable* in your world — or as narrow and specific as "West-islander tattoos (spiral patterns)" or "Missing tooth (upper-left canine)". 

**There's an infinity of options**, but don't be overwhelmed. As mentioned, the key is to _only include the really important things_, or in other words _the things that you want to be most-relevant to the game_.

### How many?

There's technically no limit on how many circumstances a character can have, but you'll more than likely run out of space on the [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] before you run out of ideas. This is a good _natural limit_, as the constraint forces you to be reserved about your choices.

However, it may also depend on the _expected length_ of your campaign. If you play the same character for long enough, you'll find yourself running out of space a lot quicker. Therefore, [multi-page character sheets](#charsheet) are also provided that give you a lot more space to flesh out your character.
