## Player Styles

> #quote
> What really makes a difference in the success or failure of a roleplaying session is **you**. Your participation, whether as \[FC\] or player, has much more influence on the fun your group has than all of the game products in the world. _Rule books are not roleplaying games, any more than a screenplay is a movie_.

**Different players may have distinct skill-sets and differing styles of play, and you may find over time that you prefer playing in one style or the other, or that your preference drifts between these styles over time.**

_This is a spectrum, with some highlighted archetypes_, not a definitive list:

### The Self-Insert

Both when you first make a [[Player Characters|Player Character]], and when you take on the role of that character and actually play them, your personality will bleed into them. _This is unavoidable_, unless you happen to be a professionally trained actor; and even then — when you think of all the stage performances, video game adaptations, and movie reboots you've seen — you'll know that two different artists can bring entirely different vibes to the same character.

However, for some players, the divide between _player_ and _character_ is more blurry; and they either make a character who is like an idealized version of themselves, or play their character not much differently from their own personality, or both. **This is not a problem**, so long as it doesn't detract from anyone else's enjoyment of the game by breaking their sense of immersion. In fact, _there's a good chance that a lot of your characters will be like this without you even realizing_, especially if you're new to roleplaying games. Just embrace it, and enjoy the feeling of being someone much like yourself in another world.

### The Artist / Engineer

This is a character created by a player who either likes to construct stories for themselves to fulfill or who wants to tinker and 'optimize their build' and master the rules to achieve their goals. These might seem like two different activities, but really they are two sides of the same coin: the narrative side, and the mechanical side.

Regardless of their play style, these players all want for the same thing: A sense of achievement. **This is not a problem**. These players are satisfied by being rewarded for their endeavors, either narratively or mechanically or both, and either in ways that they predicted or in ways that will surprise them. In fact, _[[Agora]] is a game that serves these player characters particularly well_, since it's systems are designed to entwine both modes of advancement.

### The Masochist

This is a player who enjoys seeing their character get hurt, either physically or emotionally, or who just enjoys a challenge. Often, in these cases, _the character isn't actively trying to hurt themselves, but their player keeps putting them in situations where injury or embarrassment is likely_. Perhaps it's schadenfreude, perhaps it's cathartic; but it's probably both, since their character is also an extension of themselves. Masochistic players are those who see a real world _psycho-therapeutic value_ in playing these games.

Indeed, the best masochistic players know that the game is _just a game_, and that the shared imagined world is a like sandbox, and they embrace those facts wholeheartedly. **This is not a problem**, so long as you have your [[Consent and Safety Tools]] in place (to help you explore these ideas in a safe space), and so long as you do not also harm or overly distract the other non-masochistic players.

### The Discoverer

This is a player who _doesn't know_ who or what they want their character to be, and _wants to play to find out_. They will embrace chaos to begin with — possibly deciding to roll for all of their stats and jobs, and finding ways to randomize other character aspects too, and seeing what _implied stories_ that tells them — and they will frequently do 'uncharacteristic' things in play to see what that feels like or how the world reacts, until a solid character precipitates out.

**This is not a problem**, so long as a fully-fleshed character _does_ eventually emerge, and the other players are happy to put up with them while they make discoveries. Once the character has been discovered, _the player usually transitions to one of the other styles to continue to get enjoyment out of the game;_ or else they may find a way to kill off or retire that character and begin the process again.

### The Participant

This is a character who just doesn't have much of an [[Agenda|agenda]]; either because they currently have a lot of [[Principles#Duds|'dud' Principles]], or because their player just isn't that interested in being proactive about carving out their own destiny, and would rather see where fate leads them.

To some degree, this is a player who takes on the role of _actor and audience member simultaneously_. **This is not a problem**, so long as they are having fun. They want to be amazed by their own actions _and_ by the actions of their friends, and are happy to watch things unfurl. They don't necessarily want to be lead by the hand, _but they aren't always interested in leading themselves either_.


## Talk to the Players

If you just read all of the entries above and didn't resonate with any style particularly strongly, then this is not a problem either. It means you're probably somewhere in between. In fact, _most of us are_. And it can change not just between campaigns or gaming groups, but from character to character within the same campaign, and even from session to session with the same character.

### The Conversation

_There is no right way to play a roleplaying game_, but **the act of playing a roleplaying game _necessarily_ takes the form of a conversation**. That conversation dosen't begin when when you all sit down at the table, and it doesn't end when you all leave either. Not least because we're all connected via the internet these days, but also because we all still think about the game even while we're not playing it directly.

This activity is sometimes pejoratively referred to as 'metagaming' (meaning, the game within the game), but the metagame _is also a game_, and games are fun to play. **This is not a problem.** In fact, talking about the game outside of the game is _actively encouraged_ in [[Agora]]; so long as the conversation doesn't detract from the experience, and doesn't meander too far off course, or ruin the game's pacing.

###### Self-directed Play

Moderating the conversation and pacing is one of the primary roles of the [[Facilitator]], but _experienced [[Peers]] may eventually find that they are resolving issues themselves_, **via the conversation** and a steady application of the game rules, _without the intervention of the Facilitator_. Once this starts happening frequently and consistently, then, with the approval of those Peers, the FC may as well _make themselves a [[Player Characters|Player Character]]_ and join in the fun.

At this point, the line between FC and PC and NPC begins to blur — and the shared imagined world reaches it's _most collaborative zenith_ — and the roleplaying game becomes akin to an improvisational aural tradition.

Whether this is the stated goal of your gaming group, or whether it just happens naturally through play, _or whether you are repelled by this idea;_ it will all depend on you, your friends and their respective play styles, and how much you trust each other. There's a little bit of '[[#The Participant]]' in all of us, really, and _it can be hard to let that go_.
