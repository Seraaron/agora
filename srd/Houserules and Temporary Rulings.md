###### ‘The Golden Rules’ Revised

There are a handful of popular 'golden rules' or 'zeroth rules' that show up in many other tabletop roleplaying games.

> #eg
> **There are too many variants to quote any one directly, but they can be summarized as follows:**
>
> -   _Rulings, not rules._
> -   _If you're not having fun, change the rules._
> -   _The gamemaster is always right._
> -   _The fiction supersedes all other rules._
> -   _Rules are what you make of them._

The driving sentiment behind all these phrases is roughly the same: **All of the game's rules are ignorable**.

_But are they really?_ It's a strange sentiment to front-load a reader with, not only because it lampshades their _suspension of distrust_ in the game rules, but also because it could be extended to mean that everything else written in the book you just bought is also ignorable. It's as if those designers don't really believe in the value their own work.

Yes, we could theoretically play a game without any rules at all and just 'play pretend' like elementary schoolers, _but even kids use social contracts_. People buy games to play them, and games generally have rules in them so that they can be _played consistently_ and referenced properly to settle disputes.

That said, you don't want to turn your session into a veritable courtroom hearing of quotations and section numbers either. So [[Agora]] is generally written using a _conversational tone_.

This is a rule book, but it's not a legal document: I, *the designer*, simply speak to you, *the reader* — be you player, character, or referee — and try to guide you through the rules I've written, and then give advice on how to interpret those rules. The objective is always to progress through play, using the rules, and generate 'fun' in the process.

The trick is to use the rules in the ways that best suit your table and your current situation, _in the moment_, even if they weren't strictly intended to be used that way. From this notion, we can derive an alternative 'golden rule': _**Rules are tools**_.

This very rule book, therefore, _is actually (metaphorically) a toolbox_. **You can pick up and use any tool within this book, as and when required**; and though each tool comes with a instructions on how to use it, at the end of the day _they're just guidelines_. If you think don't need a certain tool, that's great! It can just sit in the box. If you pick up the wrong tool, and use it in a way it wasn't really intended to be used for, that's also great! _So long as you don't break it in the process_. A broken tool is of no use to anybody.

Luckily, _broken metaphors are a lot easier to fix than real tools_. If you make a mistake, or try something that doesn't work, you can try to learn what went wrong and improve for next time. [[Peers#How to take good notes|Taking notes]], then, is as essential skill for all good Peers — be they PC or FC — especially while learning the game.
