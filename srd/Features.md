## Gambits

#unfinished

-   every gambit costs the same amount of caps, regardless of tier
    -   but the gambits you can take are restricted by your character tier
-   some gambits have powers that upgrade when you upgrade tier, whereas others just do their one thing and do it well
    -   gambit effects are somewhere between wod 'merits', pbta 'moves', 13th age 'powers', and exalted 'charms'
-   you must use Ego to use them
    -   but i'm not sure if it should Ego and a Check and then two options for success and failure
    -   or whether it should just be use Ego and it works
-   there's also some thematic ties that make tiers comparable to mythic concepts like 'cultivation'
    -   which i should probably both emphasize and draw inspiration from when it comes to writing gambits
-   gambits are probably not core to this game, which means that tier is probably not core either

## Tiers

**tier names:** Ordinary, Heroic (wuxia), Mythic (xuanhuan / mixed), and Immortal (xianxia).

different gambits (or maybe scars) change how you recover from stress?
