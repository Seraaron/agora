##### Dangerous Rolls

Some rolls are deemed 'dangerous'. Like [[Stressful Rolls|stressful rolls]] this modifier can be applied to any roll of any difficulty. However, it should also be used much more sparingly, because a dangerous roll indicates that the action could _kill you_, if things go wrong!

**If you fail a dangerous roll then you will either have to _lose a point of [[Health]] and suffer a [[Wounds and Scars|wound]], or die_, and even if you succeed then you'll still take a point of [[Stress|stress]].**

‚ùó Deciding whether a roll is stressful or dangerous should usually involve a discussion among [[Peers]], to ensure that everyone agrees that it makes sense.
