## Fidelity

Fidelity represents a measure of your long-term success at establishing and upholding _your truth_ — your version of reality — whatever that may be, and for whatever good or ill that it may bring to others. Fidelity is the _quintessence of kismet,_ the stuff that lets you reach mythic levels of excellence.

- **Fidelity is a gauge that _slowly ticks up to four_, and then it resets.**
- Characters _do not normally start with any Fidelity_.
- Fidelity changes infrequently, and _it progresses in two stages_, so it is best to represent earning it by filling in the white diamonds first with a small black diamond, on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], and then with a full diamond when you spend it (ie. ◇ → ◈ → ◆).

> ##### Spending Fidelity:
>
> Each point of Fidelity is _spent in **two ways** over its lifetime:_
>
> 1. First is when [[KISSing]], you may **spend a point of Fidelity to _temporarily advance_ the [[Rank|rank]] of the ability you're using by one step**.
>     - This _lets you count some extra successes on the roll_, for any dice that fall under the new rank, and for all future rolls using that same ability _until the end of the [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]]_.
>     - When you do this, you should fill in the partially-filled diamond (◈ → ◆).
>
> 2. Then _once the whole gauge is fully filled_, you may **spend it at any dramatically appropriate time to _permanently advance_ the [[Rank|rank]] of any one of your abilities by one step**.
>     - This drains the gauge and starts the whole process over again (◆◆◆◆ → ◇◇◇◇).

#### Describing Fidelity Expenditure

When you spend Fidelity, it's important to not just let it become a mechanical interaction with no other meaning or consequence. **Fidelity is a rare resource, so spending it should be a dramatic and celebrated moment**. In epic Greek fiction, these scenes would be referred to as _'aristeiai'_ or "moments of excellence".

Try to give the rest of the players some insight into your character's inner monologue, or their physical actions, as you spend your Fidelity and push yourself beyond the limits of your own expectations.

### Earning Fidelity

**You can only earn Fidelity by not faltering in your [[Creeds]]** as they are [[Challenging Principles|challenged]] by your [[Facilitator]], over the course of a [[Campaign Arcs|campaign arc]].

Your FC should ask you something like _"Which of your Creeds have not faltered?"_, during the arc's final [[Wrap Up|wrap up meeting]] or the following [[Development Sessions|development session]], to which you should respond by reading them all aloud and letting your [[Peers]] press you further and point to times when they think you _may_ have faltered:

**If you can defend your position and convince them, and prove that a [[Creeds|Creed]] is unwavering or that your [[Oaths|Oath]] is unbroken, _then and only then_ do you earn the Fidelity**. When this happens, you should partially-fill an empty diamond (◇ → ◈).

**If you find that a Creed _has_ wavered** — or if you already knew that one has [[Health#Healing|changed to regain Health]] — **then you gain a new [[Specialties|specialty]] instead**. This specialty should be related to the experiences that lead up to your changed Creed, and can be discussed or [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|voted on]] like any other character feature.

❓ **You can only earn one Fidelity per arc, _at most_**, but remember that you have _two_ Creed slots. If one Creed has faltered and another remains adamant then you gain both rewards: A point of Fidelity _and_ a new Specialty.

❗  **Once you have earned Fidelity, it cannot be taken away.** Changing or removing a Creed after carrying one for so long does not make you weaker. Altering the wording of a Creed immediately after earning Fidelity from it (but keeping the same message, or pointing it in a new direction) is also fine.

###### Changing the Gauge?

With the Fidelity gauge's size set to four, that means that **you must acquire twelve Fidelity to take _one ability_ from rank 5 to rank 2**, which — assuming you earn one Fidelity every ten sessions — would take about a hundred-and-twenty sessions! This sounds like a lot, _and it is_, but this slow kind of character progression forms a 'supercycle' that encapsulates all the other progression cycles in [[Agora]].

If you and your [[Peers]] are unhappy with the standard rate of Fidelity gain, then it is better to change the pacing of a [[Campaign Arcs|campaign arc]] — or split it into multiple smaller arcs — rather than changing the size of the Fidelity gauge itself.

Slow-paced campaigns can have 20 session long arcs, whereas fast-paced arcs may be as short as 6 sessions. It can also vary from arc to arc, so _as always_ discuss your options with your [[Peers]].
