## Campaign Arcs

Arcs are _journeys through a story_. The term comes from screenwriting where it's used to help give structure to narratives and _to [[Pitching and Planning|plan]] rises and falls in_ tension to keep an audience member interested. As players of a roleplaying game, **we often take on the positions of both actor and audience**, so it can be useful to think about the structure of the stories we want to tell using similar terms.

In [[Agora]], **arcs are collections of [[Session Structure|sessions]]**. _How many sessions?_ That depends on your pacing, and the kind of story you want to tell. The average arc length should probably be about 10 or 12 sessions, but some might only be 6 sessions, others may be 20 sessions or more!

Each arc should have a [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|theme]] to it, or a specific subplot that you want to explore. This way, an arc can be defined by many things: a special antagonist; its emotional weight; the twists and surprises; subtext or symbolism; and so on.

Try to choose one core thing to focus on per arc, and plan around it. Once that thing has been dealt with to your degree of interest or satisfaction, then the arc can come to a close — you can run another [[Development Sessions|development session]] — and the next arc can begin next session.

### Character Arcs

Separate from campaign arcs are _character arcs_, these are less within the control of your planning — as an [[Facilitator|FC]] — and are more for the [[Player Characters]] to decide on. The players themselves should be telling you — either explicitly, *or indirectly expressed through their  [[Principles]]* — roughly where they're planning to take their characters though, and what they want to see along the way. You can, _and should_, help to facilitate these subplots.

In fact, **you can run a whole game just out of character arcs**; if your players are particularly good at pushing their [[Agenda|agendas]]. The great thing about this is that it requires very little preparation on your part as the FC. So long as you _know the world_, and the _rules of the game_, and can _improvise fairly well_, then it's possible to run a whole session of [[Agora]] with just a cursory glance at the PC's Principles before you start playing and a few minutes thinking about how to [[Challenging Principles|challenge them]].

#question This takes time and experience, however, and _[[Player Styles|some players]] prefer their FC to lead them_ more than the other way around.

### Structure

A campaign, then, is built out of arcs: _As many as are needed to tell a satisfying story._ Some campaigns can go on for as long as everyone is happy to keep playing, for many hundreds of sessions, but others come to a definite conclusion from which you can then start a new game.

A good campaign length to aim for would be 2 arcs worth, at least to start with. That way you can learn the game, see how it's reward structures and subsystems work, and really get a change to settle in to your characters. After two arcs, decide [[Peers|as a group]] whether you want to continue playing, start a new campaign, or perhaps move on to a different game entirely. That's ok too. _You don't have to play [[Agora]] forever._

#### Maintenance

The best time to run a [[Development Sessions|development session]] is between arcs. A development session is like an extra-long [[Wrap Up|wrap up meeting]], or a second '[[Development Sessions#The First Dev Session|session zero]]', where you get to discuss the game so far, improve or change your characters, and so on. These **development sessions are also when you have the opportunity to gain [[Fidelity]], and [[Development Sessions#Changing Features|change or gain features]]**.

Many tables never actually finish a campaign, which is a shame. Scheduling development sessions might seem like an unnecessary interruption at first, but some general out-of-game maintenance can improve the long term health and stability of your game, avoid Facilitator burnout, and help to ensure that you finish a game.

#important In spite of the name, a development session doesn't have to take up a full session; but there can be a lot to cover in them, so you should try to leave _at least half_ a session's worth of time for them.
