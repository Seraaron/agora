### _Optional:_ NPCs don't roll

[[Agora]] can be played in such a way that _the [[Facilitator|FC]] never has to roll dice_ for an [[Non-player Characters|Non-Player Character]]. Or said another way, **only the players roll**.

Because of both the _time and emotional investments_ required of [[Tasks]], and the need to push for an [[Agenda|agenda]], we _almost never care_ about seeing NPCs doing the same. This isn't to say that the NPCs have no agency, but rather that seeing how the [[Player Characters|PCs]] react to them is _simply more interesting_ and more engaging for everyone else at the table too.

Generally speaking, a [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]] should be re-framed so that a PC leads the roll and the NPC [[Helping|helps]] or hinders.

> #eg
> When fighting, players should roll to hit their enemies, as expected, but would then _roll to dodge or parry when their enemies try to hit back_.

NPC character sheets and [enemy stat blocks](#unfinished) are also written in such a way that makes it easier for an FC to [[Difficulties and Consequences|determine the difficulty of a roll]] and keeping the game move forwards.

The only difficulty with implementing this is ‘what to do about player versus player conflicts’, but that's where [[Opposed Tasks|opposed Tasks]] come in handy.

### Exceptions

-   NPC checks? #unfinished
-   When rolling on [[Random Events|random tables]] or otherwise needing to _simulate randomness_, an FC may of course roll dice; but this is usually done with only a single d6, 2d6, or a [[D66 Jobs|d66]], not with a [dice pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_pool).
-   When acting on another player's behalf, with their permission. This is usually because they can't attend the session, but their character is still _involved and invested_ in a scene.
