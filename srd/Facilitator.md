# The Facilitator

The Facilitator is _one of the other players at the table_, a friend, who simply **takes on a different role from you** in the game. The FC, for short — pronounced /ef·si/ — is similar to the '[Game Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster)' or 'Referee' in other tabletop games, but [[Agora]] uses this alternative term 'Facilitator' _because of their deemphasized position as the sole arbitrator_ of the game, thanks to the [[Peers]] system.

> ##### A Facilitator's main duties are to:
>
> -   **Manage the game**, by [[Pitching and Planning|pitching]] it to the other players, organizing when to play, and encouraging a dialogue with them about their characters and the game rules _between sessions_.
>
> -   **Author the world** and the scenarios the [[Player Characters]] will find themselves in by [[Pitching and Planning|planning]] for various outcomes, coming up with new plot hooks and story threads, and playing as any creatures and characters that aren't portrayed by the other players (ie. playing as the [[Non-player Characters]])
>
> -   **Interpret the player's intentions** and respond accordingly, by describing the environments and situations their characters enter and explore.
>
> -   **Direct and moderate play** by controlling the pace of each [[scene]], determining [[When to roll dice|when a player should roll dice]] and which [[Abilities|abilities]] or [[Jobs|jobs]] they should use, and [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|creating consequences]] when they fail.
>
> -   **Officiate over new rulings** when a player tries to do something that hasn't already been accounted for by the games rules or [[Houserules and Temporary Rulings|previous rulings]].
>
> -   **[[Challenging Principles|And to challenge each character's Principles]]**, to make them push for an [[Agenda|agenda]] with almost every roll.
