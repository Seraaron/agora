# The Facilitator

The Facilitator is _one of the other players at the table_, a friend, who simply **takes on a different role from you** in the game. The FC, for short — pronounced /ef·si/ — is similar to the '[Game Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster)' or 'Referee' in other tabletop games, but [[Agora]] uses this alternative term 'Facilitator' _because of their deemphasized position as the sole arbitrator_ of the game, thanks to the [[Peers]] system.

> #### _A Facilitator's main duties are to:_
>
> - **Manage the game**, by [[Pitching and Planning*|pitching]] it to the other players, organizing when to play, and encouraging a dialogue with them about their characters and the game world _between sessions_.
>
> - **Play the world** and author the scenarios the [[Player Characters]] will find themselves in by [[Pitching and Planning*|planning]] for various outcomes, coming up with new plot hooks and story threads, and roleplaying as any creatures or characters that aren't portrayed by the other players (ie. the [[Non-player Characters*]])
>
> - **Interpret the player's intentions** and respond accordingly — by describing the environments and situations their characters enter and explore — and by [[Difficulties and Consequences|creating consequences]] for those actions once the [[Agenda#Actions and Objectives|objectives]] are clear.
>
> - **Direct and moderate play** by controlling the pace of each [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]], determining [[When to roll dice|when a player should roll dice]] and which [[Abilities|abilities]] or [[Jobs|jobs]] they should use, and [[Difficulties and Consequences#Setting Difficulties|setting the difficulty]] for most rolls.
>
> - **Officiate over new rulings** when a player tries to do something that hasn't already been accounted for by the game's current rules or any [[Houserules and Temporary Rulings*|previous rulings]].
>
> - **[[Challenging Principles|And to challenge each character's Principles]]**, to make them push for an [[Agenda|agenda]] with almost every roll.

❗ If you've played any other RPGs before, then you may continue to call the Facilitator a 'GM' out of habit, but if you do then try to consider them a 'game moderator' rather than a 'game _master_'.
