## Lots

Lots represent the smallest parcel of fate that a player can use to manipulate their character's destiny. You can think of them as _tiny cosmic favors_ that you can trade to influence the dice, like cashing in a bit of karma.

- **You can have _up to eight_ Lots at a time**.
- Every character starts the game with 1d6 Lots, or you may _take the average_ and start with 3 Lots.
- Lots can be represented on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] by filling in or erasing the diamonds (◇ ↔ ◆), or by using glass beads, the faces of an eight-sided die, or some other kind of token.

> ##### Spending Lots:

> - **Spending a Lot on a roll counts as a [[KISSing|KISS]]**, letting you re-roll a die of your choice _with no questions asked_.
> - You may **convert Lots into [[Earning Experience|exp]]** for any [[Jobs|jobs]] of your choice during [[Downtime and Travel|downtime]], or between session gaps, or _**if your are ever about to exceed the eight Lots maximum**_ **then you may convert it too**.
>     - The conversion ratio is 1:1.

### Earning Lots

There is no way to earn Lots during a session, unlike [[Ego]], but **there are four ways to earn Lots at the end of each session**.
