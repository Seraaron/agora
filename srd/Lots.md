## Lots

Lots represent the smallest parcel of fate that a player can use to manipulate their character's destiny. You can think of them as _tiny cosmic favors_ that you can trade to influence the dice, like cashing in a bit of karma.

- **You can have _up to eight_ Lots at a time**.
- Every character starts the game with 2 Lots.
- Lots can be represented on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]] by filling in or erasing the diamonds (◇ ↔ ◆), or by using glass beads, the faces of an eight-sided die, or some other kind of token.

> ##### Spending Lots:
>
> - **Before a roll, _in conjunction with an appropriate [[Conditions|condition]]_, spend a Lot to gain bonus dice equal to your current [[Health]]**. Check the condition off afterwards.
> - **During a roll, spend a Lot to counts as a valid [[KISSing|KISS]]**, letting you re-roll a die of your choice, _with no questions asked_.
> - **Exceeding the _8 Lot maximum_, at any time, will immediately convert into [[Earning Experience|exp]] for any [[Jobs|jobs]] of your choice**. (The conversion ratio is 1:1).
> - **During [[Downtime and Travel*|downtime]], bonus [[Earning Experience|exp]] can be generated by spending Lots.** (With a conversion ratio of 2:1).

### Earning Lots

The only way to earn a Lot mid-session is by [[Ego#Regaining Ego|gaining Ego]] while you already it: This grants you 2 Lots per Ego. Other than that **there are four ways to earn Lots at the end of each session**.
