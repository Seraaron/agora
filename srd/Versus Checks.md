### Versus Checks

When two or more characters want to compete to do the same thing, with equal or opposite objectives — such as race to a goal, or say something important before the other can interrupt, or solve a problem the quickest — where there would be _a clear winner at the end of the action_ and no other major obstacles — then all those characters should each **perform a [[Checks|Check]] separately**, _using the same ability and difficulty_, and **the one with the most successes wins**.

**If there's a tie** then you either reach the goal simultaneously or the competition continues using a different [[Abilities|ability]] until a clear winner is found, or _whatever makes more sense_.

>
> A chase might start off as a [[Swiftness]] check; but then progress to a [[Finesse]] check if you run into a busy market and start throwing stalls over and dodging between carts; and could then go to an [[Endurance]] check if you're still neck and neck.

**Use an [[Opposed Tasks|Opposed task]] roll to resolve more complex competing agendas**, or a full [[Understanding Conflicts|conflict system]] for a detailed breakdown of the moment-to-moment action.
