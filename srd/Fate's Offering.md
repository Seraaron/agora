### *Optional:* Fate's Offering

Should your character fail in their [[Tasks|Task]], by not meeting the number of factors with successes, then _none of their objectives will be fulfilled;_ and in fact, often the *opposite* of what was wanted comes true instead as **the FC may subvert a failed agenda**.

To lessen the impact of these all-or-nothing _narrative gambles_, you can 'offer a die' to your [[Facilitator]], to guarantee a portion of the outcome for yourself. If your FC accepts, **remove one of your yet-to-be-rolled dice from your main dice pool to _ensure_ that one of your side objectives is met**.

#imp A helping die cannot be spent this way.

> #nb
> As you offer the die, describe what you're doing to ensure success in this one area — representing a _narrative sacrifice_ — which may affect the consequences of the whole roll, if the FC accepts it.

Your FC even may allow you to _make multiple offerings_, each costing a die, but **at least one objective (ie. the _main_ objective) must remain with all the other factors**, so there's still dice to be rolled for the Task.

Thus, for each accepted offering, the objectives are fulfilled regardless of the outcome of the rest of the roll.

###### Why?

The offering is optional because not every player will want to do it: **It literally makes the Task harder**, because you've just sacrificed a die, _but the number of factors remains the same_.

Still, the temptation to make an offering should always there because _it trades mechanical potential for narrative certainty_.

#imp In practice, you will find that certain [[Player Characters#Player Character Styles|player types]] will make offerings regularly, whereas others will neglect this mechanic entirely. _That's perfectly alright._ Everyone gets enjoyment out of this game differently.
