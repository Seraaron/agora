# Abilities

There are **six core abilities** in [[Agora]], split into two groups — **[[#Mental Abilities|mental]]** and **[[#Physical Abilities|physical]]**. These abilities describe all the major faculties of a character's mind and body, using [[Rank|ranks]] to numerically summarize those aspects in very broad strokes.

There's also a third group of _optional abilities_, called [[Capabilities|capabilities]], which may be changed out and _rederived when necessary_ (although that shouldn't happen too often).

## Mental Abilities

The mental abilities are called **[[Appeal]]**, **[[Resolve]]**, and **[[Wits]]**. They cover the majority of your sensory systems, your power to think and feel as a sapient creature, your basic social skills and language usage, your general acumen and perceptions, and so on. You should [[Checks vs. Tasks|make rolls]] using the [[Rank|rank]] of a mental ability whenever conflict or tension arises from an action that predominantly uses your mind.

## Physical Abilities

The physical abilities are called **[[Finesse]]**, **[[Endurance]]**, and **[[Swiftness]]**. They cover the majority of your muscular systems, your power to move and survive as an animate creature, your basic athletic skills and tool usage, your general fitness and tactile senses, and so on. You should [[Checks vs. Tasks|make rolls]] using the [[Rank|rank]] of a physical ability whenever conflict or tension arises from an action that predominantly uses your body.

###### Alternative Abilities

If you've played a certain _very popular_ tabletop roleplaying game or any of its kin, then you may have noticed a nod towards the 'standard six' abilities (ie. Cha, Int, Wis, Dex, Con, Str) in the descriptions above. The similarities are deliberate, in case you feel that the standard six are just easier for you and your group to consistently say and use.

You may of course rename the abilities to anything you like if you feel it would be appropriate for your [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|game's setting or tone]] — so long as your [[Peers]] agree and you keep them consistent — and a character sheet with blank ability names is [available](#charsheet) for you to do _just that_ — but before you do, consider that the differences presented here are _also deliberate_. **For example**, there is a symmetry in _'grace'_, _'fortitude'_, and _'speed'_ between the mental and physical abilities.

Furthermore, our choice of words posits that traditional notions of 'strength' and 'intelligence' are not so easy to define as some might make it seem, and that our social capacity as sapient beings is intertwined with all of our mental faculties.
