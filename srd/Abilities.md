# Abilities

There are **six core abilities** in [[Agora]], split into two groups â€” **[[#Mental Abilities|mental]]** and **[[#Physical Abilities|physical]]**. These abilities describe all the major faculties of a character's mind and body, using [[Rank|ranks]] to numerically summarize those aspects in very broad strokes.

There's also a third group of _optional abilities_, called [[Capabilities|capabilities]], which may be changed out and _rederived when necessary_ (although that shouldn't happen too often).

## Mental Abilities

The mental abilities are called **[[Appeal]]**, **[[Resolve]]**, and **[[Wits]]**. They cover the majority of your sensory systems, your power to think and feel as a sapient creature, your basic social skills and language usage, your general acumen and perceptions, and so on. You should [[Using Checks and Tasks|make rolls]] using the [[Rank|rank]] of a mental ability whenever conflict or tension arises from an action that predominantly uses your mind.

You should [[Using Checks and Tasks|make rolls]] using the [[Rank|rank]] of a physical ability whenever conflict or tension arises from an action that predominantly uses your body.
