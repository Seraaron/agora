## Helping and Hindering

When another character is performing a roll and it isn't your [[turn]] but you'd still like to be involved, then you may offer to aid them or try to obstruct their progress. These actions are called **[[Helping|helping]]** and **[[Hindering|hindering]]**, respectively.

Similarly, when an [[Non-player Characters|NPC]] is present and the [[Facilitator|FC]] decides they have an aligning or opposed agenda to that character then the NPC may help or hinder also.

A player can also _spend favor_ with a [[VINPCs|VINPC]] to get them to help, or to hinder another, if they are already present in the scene.

###### Persuading Helpers

**Help is a very useful mechanic**. You should probably _try to get help on every roll in the game_, but there is no inherent mechanical incentive for helpers to help you: The upside for the roller is great — _an independent bonus die that isn't affected by stress_ — but the potential downside for the helper(s) can also be severe — _being tied to the consequences of failure_.

So you may have to persuade another character to help you, offering them narrative incentives. For [[VINPCs]], this is where the _[[VINPCs#Favor|favor]]_ system comes in handy. For fellow [[Player Characters|PCs]], this could be anything from a promise of returned help later to a literal payment of some sort.
