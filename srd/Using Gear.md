## Using Gear

#rewrite
Some jobs require [[Assets and Gear|gear]] to be used properly, which is also listed with them: This is usually things like tools, weapons, armor, or materials. **If you don't have the right gear then that counts as a [[Difficulties and Consequences|difficulty factor]] against you**, and in some cases *if you don't have anything that could work as a substitute then you just can't use that job at all*.

### Breakable vs. Limited-use

Some bits of gear will have one of two special tags, `breakable` or `limited-use`, followed by a number. These tags both indicate that the gear in question can only be used so many times, but their mechanics are slightly different:

-   **`Breakable`** gear has a number next to it which _indicates the minimum number of natural 1s you must roll at once to break it_. When this finally happens it gains the `broken` tag, meaning that *you can only use it one more time* before it's completely destroyed (unless you get it repaired).
-   **`Limited-use`** gear has a number next to it which _indicates exactly how many uses are left_. Reduce this number by 1 every time you use it, until the number reaches 0; at which point you can remove the item from your character sheet.

> ### Eg.
> A bronze sword might have the `breakable 2` tag, meaning that it will break as soon as you roll two or more 1s at once while using it. Whereas a steel sword might be `breakable 4`, meaning that it will only break if you ever roll four 1s at once.

#important A lot of limited-use gear is listed with a dice value instead of a fixed number — `limited-use 2d6`, for example — and this simply means _you should roll those dice and sum the total before adding the piece of gear to your sheet_ to determine how many uses you'll get out of it.
