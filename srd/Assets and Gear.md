# Assets & Gear

Assets and gear represent things that you physically own (or at least possess), or more abstract things that are assigned to you — but which you can still leverage in the same way as a possession — such as your position in a clan or notoriety in wider society.

In other words: _Assets and gear are objects, places, or concepts that you can interact with in game._

**They each have a 'die rating', which is literally how many dice you can add to a roll when you use it.** These dice inherit the [[Rank|rank]] of the [[Abilities|ability]] you use with the roll, so they're added to your main pool (not rolled separately).

❓ **The highest die rating is +5**, but it can go higher under _exceptional circumstances_. Still, +5 is the highest die rating a character can start with, without [[Peers|Peer]] permission.

## Assets

Assets can be loosely divided into two categories: [[#Capital]] and [[#Prestige]]. They are narratively different, but _mechanically identical_. **The more dice they're worth the more expensive, important, or useful they are**.

Either way, **you can get very creative with what you want to represent as an asset**. The usefulness of any given asset should always be fairly self-evident or else come with a description or explanation.

> ### Eg.
>
> If you're a doctor and own a +2 Infirmary (capital) asset, then it can grant you a +2 bonus to your rolls when you perform surgery inside of it — indicating that it's well staffed and stocked.
>
> If you're a doctor and you have a +2 Reputation (prestige) asset for being a ‘good doctor’, then it won't necessarily grant you any bonus to your actual doctoring rolls, but it may help out in social situations to persuade people that you're a capable surgeon, helping to attract new customers.

All assets cost the same number of _'caps'_ during [[Character Assembly|character assembly]]. Simply take the number of dice you wish to asset to provide you with, add one, and multiply the total by five. That is:

$$
Asset Cost (¢) = (Dice + 1) \times 5
$$

❓ There is no set list of what is or isn't an asset, but a list of examples and their costs is provided in the [[Asset Examples List]].

### Capital

Most capital assets have direct uses — _investments can grow in value, buildings can be used and lived in, land can be worked, ships and trains can transport people or things, castles can defend against armies, magical swords can slay monsters, and art can be used as tax write-offs_ — but you typically **only add the dice from a capital asset to your rolls when you use the it in a way that would actually grant you a bonus**, where the die rating represents its quality and worth.

> ### Eg.
>
> Great funds and fortunes, or inherited resources; shares in a business; fine art and furniture; rare artefacts and treasures; or livestock and farmland.
>
> Also includes property like buildings.

### Prestige

Prestigious assets — _also called reputations, influence, community, affiliations, or organization dice_ — are most commonly used when you try to leverage your reputation or position to get what you want.

They can grant you access to places or people than you would otherwise struggle to get to with fewer questions asked, or they can represent a traded favor here, and a whispered name there. They make you important within a given setting or [[Factions, Institutions, Organizations|faction]], and they make you more likely to be listened to or taken seriously in certain social contexts, or they might help you strike fear into your enemies if your influence makes you particularly domineering or dreadful.

> ### Eg.
>
> Your importance to and connections within an organization or societal group; your allegiance to a particular faction or philosophy; your guild titles or noble honors; a reputation for doing something that makes you (_in_)famous — regardless of whether there's any truth to the claims — or anything else that might bring you renown or clout.

## Gear

Gear highlights _the most important objects  you own_, the things you hold dearest or rely upon regularly. They can be lost, broken, traded, or stolen — but equally, new gear can acquired by finding, repairing, buying, or stealing them in kind.

> ### Eg.
>
> Mundane items, equipment, and bits of kit; tools and weapons; special articles of clothing and outfits, or personal effects; armor, helmets and shields; simple vehicles, like small boats and carts; supplies and sundry items; jewels, valuable materials, or simple cash-money.

Gear is technically a just a special type of asset — representing your equipment, tools, materials, and small valuables — but the biggest difference is that bits of gear have '[[#Tags|tags]]' that identify specific uses or effects when used, whereas normal assets are more interpretive and may be applied to rolls that wouldn't necessarily use gear.

### Tags

**Tags apply specific rules to specific items.** They are all written in lower case, following a hash sign (#), and multi-word tags are hyphenated (-). Tags are used both to price items of otherwise equivalent die ratings, and to identify the item itself.

Each tags is fully explained in the [[Tags List]].

❓ Just about any object can be to be considered a piece of gear, so making up new things on the fly is fairly easy using the tagging system. In fact, **almost all gear is ultimately just a collection of dice and tags**.

> ### Eg.
>
> A **broadsword** is a #warrior #medium #rending piece of gear.
>
> - Warrior means that you use it with the [[Warrior]] job.
> - Medium indicates its [[Carry Weight|weight]], and also how it can be wielded.
> - Rending is a damage type that means it cuts deep.
>
> These three tags could potentially describe _any number of other medium-sized cutting weapons_ that also use the Warrior job.

### Quality Rating

Most gear has a 'quality rating', or QR for short, _weapons and tools especially_. This represents both the die bonus the gear grants — equivalent to the normal die rating of an [[#Assets|asset]] — but also its rarity and craftsmanship.

| Dice | QR                        | Short | Explanation                                                                                                                  |
| :--: | :------------------------ | :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  +0  | **[[Common-Quality]]**    |   CQ  | Cheap to buy and easy to replace. Run-of-the-mill. Almost all vendors will sell goods of this quality.                       |
|  +1  | **[[Excellent-Quality]]** |   EQ  | More expensive, but more durable and repairable too. May require a specialist to purchase goods of such high quality.        |
|  +2  | **[[Superior-Quality]]**  |   SQ  | Rare and exquisite goods of master craftsmanship. Difficult to find and seldom sold to strangers, even if you can afford it. |

Mechanically, _quality ratings exist for gear to limit their availability and power_. This is because gear dice can be added to many more interactions than most asset dice. Any time you use most physical jobs, and especially any time you get into a fight, you'll be using gear.

❓ [[#Tags]] make up the difference in cost compared to other assets though, granting bonus dice to specific interactions or bypassing the normal rules of play.

### Required Gear

**Sometimes an item or piece of gear is required to perform certain [[Jobs|jobs]].** This is indicated each of their descriptions, but you can add a pilcrow sign ¶ to the start of a job's name when you write it on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]] to remind you that it has some kind of special requirement.

**If you don't have the exactly the right gear for a job then it counts as a [[Difficulties and Consequences|difficulty factor]] against you.** If you don't have _any_ suitable substitutes or replacement items that could fill the same roll as the tools for a single roll, then you will suffer a **doubled base difficulty penalty**. Or in some cases the [[Facilitator|FC]] may rule that no roll can be made at all.

> ### Eg.
>
> Using the [[Smith]] job requires a workshop or foundry, materials to make what you want, and #craft tools — stuff like hammers, tongs, vices, calipers, and a good thick apron.
>
> If you're not working in ideal conditions, _say_, outside with a pot furnace, while borrowing a masonry hammer, then  that will count as a difficulty factor.
>
> If you've got nothing to use as a hammer except for a rock you just found the floor, then that would double the base difficulty.
>
> _If you don't even have a furnace_, and your objective requires the heating of metal, then the roll is simply not possible to attempt at this time.

### Breaking Gear

Gear can break when it's used. **When you make a roll that [[#Required Gear|required]] a piece of gear, _and that roll fails_**, then there is a chance that the gear you just used will get damaged at the end of the [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]]:

- **Roll a d6.** If you rolled a 1, your gear gains the #damaged tag.
- **A damaged item can be used _one more time_ before it breaks,** regardless of success or failure for the roll it's used on.
- Broken items can be repaired, but this takes time and skill.

❓ If the 'damaged gear' is more like a _limited quantity_ item that you'd run out of — like ammunition, vials of liquid, or reagents and  powders — then give it the #single-use tag instead, and it cannot be repaired.

![[Repairing Items]]

### Magical & High-tech Gear

Magical or high-tech items are special cases. They can either be thought of as assets that also function as gear, or as bits of gear that have the #capital or #prestige tags — indicating that just owning the item also confers a reputation onto you.

Not only that, but **magical and high-tech items will make all your [[Exploding Dice|dice explode]], when used**. Most also come with unique effects that can functionally resemble [[Gambits|gambits]] or [[spells]].

All of this makes magic and high-tech items _very valuable_ indeed.

❓ Currently, no examples of magic items are provided in the [[Agora]] SRD.
