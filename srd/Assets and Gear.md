# Assets & Gear

Assets and gear mostly represent things that you physically own (or at least possess), and occasionally more abstract things that are assigned to you — but which you can still leverage in the same way as a possession — such as your position in a clan or notoriety in wider society.

In other words: _Assets and gear are objects, places, or concepts that you can interact with in game._

-   They each have a 'die rating', **which is literally how many dice you can add to a roll when you use it.**
    -   These dice inherit the [[Rank|rank]] of the [[Abilities|ability]] you use with the roll, so they're added to your main pool (not rolled separately).
-   **You can only use _one asset or piece of gear_ per roll**, but there is no limit to how many you can have, _except for common sense_.

## Assets
Assets can be broadly divided into two categories, capital and prestige. They are narratively different, but mechanically identical: That is, **the more dice they're worth the more expensive, important, or useful they are**.

### Capital

Most capital assets have direct uses — investments can grow in value, buildings can be used and lived in, land can be worked, ships and trains can transport people or things, magical swords can slay monsters, and art can be used as tax write-offs — but you typically only add the dice from a capital asset to your rolls when you use the it in a way that would actually grant you a bonus, _where the die rating represent its quality and worth_.

> ### Eg.
> Property and real estate; great funds and fortunes, or inherited resources; shares in a business; large vehicles or machines; fine art and furniture; rare artefacts and treasures; livestock or farmland; or any other large quantities of wealth or stores of value that are not easily transferable.

In all of these cases, the usefulness of asset in question should be fairly implicit or else come with a description or explanation.

### Prestige

Prestigious assets are most commonly used when you try to leverage your reputation or position to get what you want.

> ### Eg.
> Your importance to and connections within an organization or societal group; your allegiance to a particular faction or philosophy; your guild titles or noble honors; a reputation for doing something that makes you (_in_)famous — regardless of whether there's any truth to the claims — or anything else that might bring you renown or clout.

They can grant you access to places or people than you would otherwise struggle to get to with fewer questions asked, or they can represent a traded favor here, and a whispered name there. They make you important within a given setting or faction, and they make you more likely to be listened to or taken seriously in certain social contexts, or they might help you strike fear into your enemies if your influence makes you particularly domineering or dreadful.

## Gear

Gear highlights _the most important objects  you own_, the things you hold dearest or rely upon regularly. It can be lost, traded, or stolen; but equally, new gear can acquired by finding, buying, or stealing them in kind.

> ### Eg.
> Mundane items, equipment, and bits of kit; tools and weapons; special articles of clothing and outfits, or personal effects; armor and other panoply; simple vehicles, like small boats and carts; supplies and sundry items; jewels, valuable materials, or simple cash money.

Gear is technically a just a special type of asset — representing your equipment, tools, materials, and small valuables — but the biggest difference is that bits of gear have other '[[Tags List|tags]]' that identify specific uses or effects when used, whereas normal assets are more interpretive and may be applied to rolls that wouldn't necessarily use gear.

#question Gear can be just about any object can be considered a piece of gear, so making up new things on the fly is fairly easy using the tagging system ([[#Tags|see below]]).

#### Required Gear

#rewrite

**Sometimes a piece of gear is required to perform certain [[Jobs|jobs]].** This is represented with `tool` tags, so that tracking which items can be used for what jobs is a lot easier. Most of this kind of gear has a die rating of +0, simply to indicate that it enables you to use the job in question, but doesn't provide any inherent bonus. Higher quality tools might worth +1 or +2 dice though.

By default, **you are assumed to have all of the tools and required gear for all Walks of Life that you have taken _more than once_**[[#Notes|¹]], with a die rating of +0. But unless they're `breakable` or `limited-use`, you probably don't even need to write them on your sheet.

If you don't have the required gear then it counts as a [[Difficulties and Consequences|difficulty factor]] against you.

#### Magical / High-tech Gear

Magical or high-tech items are special cases, because they can either be thought of as assets that also function as gear, or as bits of gear that have the `capital` and/or `prestige` tags; indicating that just owning the item also confers its reputation onto you.

Not only that, but magical and high-tech items almost always bare the `open-ended` tag and also come with unique effects that can functionally resemble [[Features|gambits]]. This is explained in more detail, with examples, in the [[magical subsystem|magic items module]].

All of this makes magic and high-tech items _very valuable_ indeed.

## Tags

Tags can all be written in lower case, after the die rating and name of an asset, separated by commas on your character sheet. An asset may have 'obvious' tags which you don't need to write, to save space, if the name of the asset effectively tells you what its tags already are.

> ### Eg.
> A "**+1 · Bronze short sword · `breakable 2`**" is quite obviously a `short`, `sharp`, `melee`, `weapon` that provides a +1 die bonus to rolls when you use it, so those tags aren't needed to describe it. Only the `breakable 2` tag is explicitly needed to represent the malleable quality of the bronze material.
