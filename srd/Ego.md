## Ego

Ego represents _quite literally_ your character's sense of self, and also the part of their psyche that believes they have control over their own reality. _Ego is a force:_ A force that makes the world conform to your vision.

- **You either have Ego, or you don't**, at any given time.
- Every character starts the game with Ego, unless you choose to start with an extra +1d6 Lots instead.
- You can represent whether you currently have Ego or not by filling in or erasing the diamond (◇ ↔ ◆) on your [[Character Sheets|character sheet]], using the faces of a coin or a playing card, or using some other kind of binary token.

> ##### Spending Ego:
>
> - **Spending Ego on a roll counts all your 6s _twice_**, after [[KISSing]]. Meaning that your all 6s effectively turn into double-successes.
> - **If you want to spend Ego on an [[Exploding Dice|exploding roll]], then you can instead _roll additional exploding dice_ equal to your current [[Health]]**. Though these bonus dice are _unKISSable_.

### Regaining Ego

There are three ways to regain Ego during a session, and three ways to earn it at the end of each session. _If you would have earned Ego_, but already have it, then gain a [[Lots|Lot]] instead. (And if you're already full up on Lots too, then add a point of _[[Earning Experience|exp]]_ to a job of your choice instead).

![[End-of-Session Ego Rewards]]

If multiple questions are true then the additional Ego converts into Lots or [[Earning Experience|exp]].
