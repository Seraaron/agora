## Ego

Ego represents _quite literally_ your character's sense of self, and also the part of their psyche that believes they have control over their own reality. _Ego is a force:_ A force that makes the world conform to your vision.

- **You either have Ego, or you don't**, at any given time.
- Every character starts the game with Ego, unless you choose to start with an extra +1d6 Lots instead.
- You can represent whether you currently have Ego or not by filling in or erasing the diamond (◇ ↔ ◆) on your [[Character Resources|character sheet]], using the faces of a coin or a playing card, or using some other kind of binary token.

> ##### Spending Ego:
>
> - **Spending Ego on a roll counts all your 6s _twice_**, after [[KISSing]]. Meaning that your all 6s effectively turn into double-successes.
> - **If you want to spend Ego on an [[Exploding Dice|exploding roll]], then you must instead _roll additional exploding dice_ equal to your current [[Health]]**. Though these bonus dice are _unKISSable_.

### Regaining Ego

There are three ways to regain Ego during a session, and three ways to earn it at the end of each session.

![[End-of-Session Ego Rewards]]

#### Excess Ego = 2 Lots

If you find that multiple questions are true, or if you already have Ego when one of the in-game conditions is met, then each point of Ego is converted into 2 [[Lots]]. Any excess Lots _above eight_ are converted to [[Earning Experience|exp]].
