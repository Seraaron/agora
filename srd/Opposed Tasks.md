### Opposed Tasks

The [[Player Characters]] may sometimes find themselves at odds with one another — either by getting argumentative or by literally fighting, or competing in some other way — and will begin to take sides. At some point this will come to a head, and the [[Facilitator|FC]] should declare that a roll needs to happen to settle the matter.

Assuming that the opposition is complex enough to warrant a [[Tasks|Task]] roll, and can't simply be resolved with a [[Checks#Versus Checks|Versus Check]], then you must decide if the Task is **[[#Symmetrical Opposition|symmetrically opposed]]** or **[[#Asymmetrical Opposition|asymmetrically opposed]]**.

> If two or more characters already agree or want to work together to achieve the same objective against the others, then one player should lead the roll and the rest should [[Helping|help]].

#### Symmetrical Opposition

This is where each sides of the conflict have basically _equal but opposite_ agendas —where victory for one side means a total loss for all the others — a so-called '[zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game)'. Each party simultaneously takes actions to get what they want while also trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same.

> #eg
> Two characters are fighting and they each want to subdue or injure the other. Or racing to see who will finish first. Or each is trying to persuade a neutral third party of something with arguments for and against the other positions.

Start by working out what the opposed [[Agenda|agendas]] are, and which [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|difficulty factors]] apply to each side. _The set-up and rolling phases are largely the same as a normal Task_, except that you go through it with all rolling parties at once. Each side may have different side objectives (which they may make offerings for) but they should all have the same main objective.

#imp When you get to [[KISSing]] be careful to **declare all KISSes on all sides _before re-rolling_**, so that no-one gains special knowledge about the other's fate before committing to the roll.

Finally, for the outcome phase: **The side with the most successes _who has also overcome the difficulty factors_ is declared the winner of the Task**. If no one overcomes the difficulty then no side wins, and you'll have to work out what that looks like for yourselves.

##### Breaking ties: Win–Win or Lose–Lose?

#rewrite
If two or more sides have an equal number of successes, then **the side with the fewest difficulty factors wins**.

Otherwise if everything is equally matched then you must simply _decide as [[Peers]] what kind of outcome makes the most sense:_ Either the tied opponents all get what they want, at the expense of each other; or no one really gets what they wanted, a compromise is found, and the opportunity to try again is removed.

> #eg **(cont.)**
> The two characters fighting both subdue and injure each other at the same time. The racing characters finish simultaneously, and are awarded a joint prize. The third party in the argument decides to weigh each position equally and find the middle ground.

###### Player vs. Player interactions

Using opposed Tasks to resolve in-game character conflicts can be incredibly useful and satisfying, especially for group decision-making: It forces the players to really formulate their arguments _in character_, giving them a fair chance to voice their opinions in a structured manner where everyone can respect the final result.

It might seem strange at first, but it can speed up play to just roll dice over a disagreement, accept the results, and move on; instead of arguing out of game for ages and getting nowhere.

Out of game conflicts still need to resolved in an _out of game manner_ though, by talking as [[Peers]], usually between sessions or in a [[Development sessions|development session]].

#### Asymmetrical Opposition

This is where one side wants something, and another side wants to stop them _but doesn't want to achieve anything for themselves in return_. One party is an active aggressor, and the other is a passive defender.

> #eg
> Two characters are fighting, but one is trying to hurt the other and the other is just trying to dodge and parry. Or one character is trying to persuade the other of something, but the other isn't trying to persuade them of the opposite case.

##### Defender's Advantage

In this instance, the opposed Task works almost identically to a normal Task, except **the defending side's players takes the helm from the FC to decide the difficulty factors and the consequences for the aggressor**.

_They can even spend Lots to count [[#Arbitrary Difficulty Factors|arbitrary difficulty factors]] against the other side_ (which is only expended if the opponent accepts the terms and rolls dice).

The purpose of this is to **let the defending player set the conditions to which they would accept defeat**, and committing to the result.

#que This is basically another [[Script Change Tools|consent mechanic]]: Once the opposing side has heard the conditions of the Task, they may back down, and if they do then the game moves on without a roll; but if they accept the challenge, then we know in advance that all parties will agree to the outcome of the dice rolls.
