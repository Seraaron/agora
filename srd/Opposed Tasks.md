### Opposed Tasks

Characters may sometimes find themselves at odds with one another — either by getting argumentative or by literally fighting, or competing in some other way. _At some point this will come to a head_, and the [[Facilitator|FC]] should declare that a roll needs to happen to settle the matter.

Assuming that the opposition is complex enough to warrant a [[Tasks|Task]] roll, and can't simply be resolved with a [[Versus Checks|Versus Check]], then you must form into sides during the [[Tasks#1 Set-up|set-up phase]] and each begin splitting your dice into two pools: [[#Offense and Defense]].

#### Forming Sides

If two or more characters already agree or want to work together to achieve the same objective against the others, then **these characters can pool all their dice together**, combining their job levels and asset dice and other bonuses, and allowing everyone on the same side to [[KISSing|KISS]] any dice, as per the [[Helping|help rules]].

#### Offense and Defense

Once you've chosen what job to use for the conflict, gather up those level dice, add any assets, gear, or other bonuses, a then split the total pool into two smaller pools:

- Your 'offensive' pool is rolled against _the opposing side's defensive pool_.
- Your 'defensive' pool is rolled against _the opposing side's offensive pool_.

**Asset dice should be added to the pool that makes the most sense**.

> ### Eg.
>
> For a violent conflict, weapons dice should add to the offensive pool, armor and helms should add to the defensive pool, and shields or tools can add to either pool. (Violent oppositions are always [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]]).
>
> For a rhetorical conflict, appropriate influence and prestige dice should add to the offensive pool, factions and property can be added to the defensive pool, and reputations and capital can be added to either pool. (These bonuses are fairly context-dependent, so discuss what makes most sense with your [[Peers]]).

**The [[Facilitator|FC]] may also add bonus dice to both sides**, which should usually get added to the defensive pool, **instead of adding [[Generic Difficulty Factors|generic factors]]**.  This is because the dice being rolled against one another _function as the effective difficulty_.

❓ You can choose to put all the dice you can into one pool or the other, but this can make for a fairly asymmetric conflict. _This can be a tactical decision or a narrative one_.

#### Resolution

**Roll both pools at the same time** — holding one pool in each hand, using different colored dice, if possible — and count the successes in each separately. **Your usual objective here is to overcome your opponent's defense, and to defend yourself from their offense**. _Your opponent's objectives are probably the same_.

When you come to [[KISSing|KISS]] your dice, be sure to announce which dice you're KISSing and which pool they belong to, and put them to one side while your opponent announced their KISSes too. **Once all the dice have been chosen  to be KISSed _then_ you may re-roll them**. This ensures that no one side has advanced knowledge over the fate of the other.

**The side with the _most successes_ in each opposing pool wins that half of the conflict.** Thus, there are 4 possible outcomes of this kind roll, when considering each half:

- **Your offense _beat_ their defense AND your defense _beat_ their offense.** This is a _total win_ for your side. You have lost no ground, and gained everything you wanted. The opposing side must concede. They are at your mercy.
- **Your offense _beat_ their defense BUT your defense  _lost to_ their offense.** You were _partially successful_. You are hurting, but so are they. You may have gained some ground, but it came at a cost. Something must budge. Either come to a compromise or else roll again with a different job.
- **Your offense _lost to_ their defense BUT your defense _beat_ their offense.** You _both failed_ to get what you really wanted. Neither side is particularly hurt. No ground is gained or lost. You are at an impasse. You must either agree to disagree and walk away or else roll again with a different job.
- **Your offense _lost to_ their defense AND your defense _lost to_ their offense.** This is a _total loss_ for your side. You have lost ground, and cannot gain any standing to push again. Your opponent declares victory. You are at their mercy.

If the roll was deemed to be [[Stressful Rolls|stressful]] and your defense lost against their offense then you will take [[Stress|stress]] regardless of whether your offense was successful or not.

##### Breaking Ties: Defender's Advantage

When one side's offensive successes are equal to the other side's defensive successes, or _vice versa_,  **the defensive side takes always precedence**.

To justify this, consider it this way: **Each side's defensive successes are effectively acting as the difficulty factors for the opposing side's offensive roll**. Thus, in order for an offensive roll to succeed _you must also count a base factor from the offensive roll's original objective_.

❗ **This means that in order to beat your opponent's defense you must actually get _one success more_ than their defensive roll.**
