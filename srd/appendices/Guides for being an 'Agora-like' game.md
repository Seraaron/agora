## Guides for being an 'Agora-like' game

### Core Philosophies

- Make the game you actually want to play / run
- Always be clear about the consequences of a roll
	- ie. playing rpgs is like gambling with narratives, so the player deserves to know what's at stake
- Focus on different types of conflict resolution or presenting actions with interesting choices resulting in memorable storytelling / narrative experiences
- Don't sit in the middle of the road
	- ie. make mechanics that force decisions in the player, without removing agency, so they don't get choice paralysis
	- for example, if a thing would be rated 1-3, then make it rated 1-4 or 1-2 instead so there's no middle number or 'maybe' option: those are just comfortable non-decisions
- Let the dice fall where they may, treat the dice as oracles of fate
- Say 'yes' or roll dice
- Build consent mechanics into your game
- Open-to-interpretation character creation rules that prioritize player expression over mechanical minutia
- Define everything: don't make too many assumptions of the reader, but don't be pedantic
- Putting accessibility and inclusivity features into your game is not the same as 'dumbing it down' or 'streamlining' 
	- Eg. Try to provide quick / at-a-glance rules up front, and more detailed explanations later on
	- Speak directly as the author to explain really important stuff when you need to, using sidebars or footnotes
- Use second person pronoun 'you' throughout your writing to address the reader and let context determine if that means the player, their character, or the referee
- Try to silo your systems, so that things can be modular
	- I call this 'toolbox design' because I imagine an rpg like a big box of tools that you only get out the right tools from when you need them
	- the right tool at the right time does exactly what you need it too do and nothing more
	- don't try to make 'omnitools' that can do anything / everything, because it will do those things poorly
- Mention 'Peers' or a peer-like system that encourages table talk 
	- though this is not required, it helps to keep some uniformity across play-styles
	- that is, some games may have more or less emphasis on collaborative storytelling
- You don't have to use a 'facilitator / FC' but avoid using 'game master' or 'dungeon master' (in fact, I think DM is copyrighted by WotC so *definitely* avoid that one)
	- GM or Referee are both fine

### Must-have Mechanics

- D6 pool, counting successes using rank (rated 1 to 6)
- Checks and / or Tasks (but preferably both)
- Kismet (meta-currencies) and Principles
	- You can use the one's in Agora as is, or change their uses slightly
	- But if you want to change kismet drastically then add new *types of kismet* instead, rather than still trying to call them Lots and Ego, etc.
	- Similarly, if you have an idea for another write-in box that isn't goals, habits, or creeds, then go ahead and add it (and remove the ones you don't need) rather than renaming the existing ones
- KISSing (re-roll mechanic)
	- You can move KISSes to happen before the roll if you prefer, meaning that a KISS just adds more dice to the pool instead of re-rolling
	- But don't make a new acronym that functionally does the same thing as KISSing
- Kith and Kin are desirable, but not required if NPCs aren't going to feature heavily in your game
- Assets are desirable, but not required it gear and reputations and such aren't going to feature heavily in your game
- Specialties are desirable, but not required it gear and reputations and such aren't going to feature heavily in your game
- Adversities and conditions are desirable, but not requires if resource management is not a key part of your game or if they don't tie into kismet mechanics 

#### Stamp of Compatibility

- Should you be attempting to make a product that is *directly compatible* with Agora and other agora-compatible products, with few changes required of the reader to make it work for their table, then a special logo should be put on your product so that consumers can identify that fact
- (I don't know what this logo / symbol should be yet)

### Suggestions for Hackers

- If you're not gunning for perfect compatibility, then you can rename jobs or use different stats and skills entirely if you like
- You technically don't even need abilities, and could make something very bespoke, but this will definitely make it lose direct compatibility with Agora
	- For example you could merge some abilities or make some capabilities core, eg:
		- merge Swiftness and Endurance into 'Brawn'
		- merge Wits and Resolve into 'Smarts'
		- then use the free space to add Wealth and Links as 'core abilities'

### Giving Credit

- The Agora SRD will be released under CC BY 4.0, and parts of it may also be made public domain (CC 0)
- CC BY 4.0 means that if you copy and paste text directly from the SRD then you must give credit to Seraaron and reference Agora somewhere in your product
	- but there are no license fees or other major restrictions
	- Though I might add a restriction against big companies freely using my writing, to avoid market undermining
- Avoid making direct references to other games and/or buzzwords (unless they are also under Creative Commons licenses)
- If this all somehow becomes very popular then I may make a "seraaron's seal of approval" type logo for the best Agora-like or Agora-derived products on the market, for quality assurance / endorsement purposes
