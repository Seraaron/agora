Roleplaying games come from a long and fabled tradition of 'hacking'. From Arneson and Gygax adding custom rules to Chainmail and Outdoor Survival in the 70s, to the incredible deluge of Powered by the Apocalypse games that came out in the 2010s, to even the modding scene in video games. The community that surrounds roleplaying games never cease to impress and amaze me! It's one of the main reason's that I've given Agora such an open license (CC BY 4.0).

I am a craftsman like any other, just trying to carve out a niche for myself, but it's also good to try to acknowledge the forces and people that influenced or mentored me, no matter how indirectly, rather than pretending that I pulled all this from whole cloth. Agora is a hack of a hack of a hack — it's hacks all the way down — and you should hack it too!

###### Burning Wheel

I played and ran 'Burning Wheel', by Luke Crane & Co., for about 4 years before I properly started writing Agora. It's been tremendously influential on me, and I can't deny that. But it's also, in my opinion, a _bad game_  — or, at least, a game that I'm very critical of. There's a lot of things that I adore in that game, but there's also a lot that repulses me.

At some point in 2020, I read this post on the BW community forums:

> 
> — From BWHQ's [beliefs and instincts](https://forums.burningwheel.com/t/bwhq-beliefs-and-instincts/21520)

And it inspired me to more-seriously consider the prospect of making my own game. I'd been hacking Burning Wheel from the first day I started running it, just to get it to work for my table and our play-style. Eventually it reached the point where I realized that my house-rules practically constituted an entirely different game. So at the start of 2021 I took the brave steps towards writing a completely bespoke system. Aside from the many parts that I've eschewed, there are still some elements that keep a through-line from Burning Wheel. Such as:

-   A core 'metacurrency cycle'.
-   An interesting character creation system that tells you a story about your character as you build them.
-   D6 dice pool mechanic using target numbers to count successes.
-   Pursuing hand-written character motivations as a central gameplay theme.
-   The 'Let it ride' philosophy (which I combined with the 'let the dice fall' principle seen in many other games).

Special mention must be given to 'Circles' — a sub-mechanic in BW for inventing and finding new NPCs in the world and on the fly — which was a direct inspiration for Links, but which is also a common house-rule in other games too (sometimes called the *'I Know A Guy' rule*).

###### The Bloody-Handed Name of Bronze

A _brilliant_ but somewhat esoteric game by Joshua A C Newman. The tone and style of writing in that game is just so cool, I practically fell in love the moment I read the title of the game! There are many little things that have influence me from that game, though it's hard to draw a direct lineage. For example:

-   My initial idea for Health was originally conceived of as a minimum dice pool that you always roll, similar to the Two Mortal Dice of Jet.
-   The way that difficulty is built out of factors and consequences and gets subverted based on the ones you don't choose is very cool to me, and indirectly influenced the way I wrote difficulty for Tasks into Agora.
-   And a few other narrative principles, too numerous to list directly. Just go read Bloody-Handed Name of Bronze, and you'll probably pick up on the similarities.

###### Consent and Safety Tools

The 'script change toolbox' was first designed by Beau Jágr Sheldon, but it is also directly influenced by things like Lines and Veils, the X card, and many other related tools. I just think that script change is the best _all-in-one solution_ available right now, which is why I wanted to include it directly in Agora. (That content is under a CC BY-SA license).

Peers and VINPCs are a culmination of all my thoughts on the wider conversation about collaborative storytelling, meta-gaming, and safety tools in roleplaying games: Basically, I wanted to codify a consensus method for better collaborative storytelling, and to add player protections against overly-assertive GMs. (I've released Peers and VINPCs as *public domain*, under the CC0 1.0 license).

###### Videos & Blogs

-   Matthew Colville, for his 'Running the Game' advice series. Much of which I've condensed and re-written in my own words and made more directly applicable to Agora.
-   Zee Bashew, for his _low prep_ gaming style and 'The Path' hat-trick, who was in-turn influenced by John Wick and Satine Pheonix.
-   Dael Kingsmill / Monarch's Factory, mainly for inspiring me to work on Agora as a stand-alone product, since her hacks of D&D practically turn it into a completely different game. (Hey Dael, if you're reading this, I think you should definitely write your own game too)!
-   Hankrin Ferinale of Runehammer Games and ICRPG, for the idea of using a turn order outside of combat to help with spotlighting and to make sure that everyone gets a say, and who's general thoughts and lectures on roleplaying games are always insightful.
-   Chris McDowall's essays on quantitative vs qualitative gameplay, which have influenced how I thought about almost every individual component of this game (in terms of questioning what purpose each one was serving).

###### Additional Influences

-   Jobs are primarily influenced by my love for Final Fantasy Tactics. I've always loved multi-classing / job systems in JRPGs, though Agora isn't primarily a game about tactical combat, the inclusion of jobs is still novel to me.
-   The idea for 'only players roll' came from the Cypher System, by Monte Cook Games. Though this is an optional play-style not a core rule; I tried to design Agora so that it _could be_ played this way, if one wanted.
-   'Say 'yes' or roll' was first introduced to me by Burning Wheel, but it actually comes from the now defunct 'Dogs in the Vineyard' game, by Vincent Baker.
-   A few things from Blades in the Dark, by John Harper, like the concept of stress and flashbacks, and the "Devil's Bargain" which I've subverted into "Fate's Offering", plus a generally good design ethos.
-  'Be a fan of the players' is a common sentiment shared by many Powered by the Apocalypse and Blades in the Dark type games, as are 'playbooks' or 'playsheets' — quick-start character creation options that make pick-up-and-play a lot easier.
- Kevin Crawford's GMing advice in Godbound and Worlds Without Number, especially in regards to making and running factions or religions, is _invaluable_. Definitely go check them out.
-   Exclusive Features were directly inspired by 13th Age's "One Unique Thing", by Pelgrane Press,  except that I wanted uniques to have an actual mechanical use; whereas Circumstances fulfill the more narrative / qualitative focus in Agora. 

Finally, my previous employment as a gambling auditor made me realize that roleplaying is a form of _narrative gambling_, and that if you think of it in those terms then a player _must be informed of the odds_ so that they can make informed decisions about how they want to play and what they want to put at stake. There's *a lot more* I could say about this, but let's leave it at that for now. (Word of advice: please don't gamble in real life, _you will always lose eventually_).

###### Friends and Family

-   Jen G for being such a good sport in the early days of my hacking career, putting up with all the bad rules I wrote, who helped me find the flaws in my earliest creative work, and who has made some _incredible art_ of the campaigns we've played in over the years.
-   O Moody for first becoming friends with me by heavily criticizing my BW hacks; who's insights are always valuable to me, even if I don't agree with him all of the time! 
-   Andrew Malcolm who first taught me how to *really roleplay*, and instilled a sense of wonder in me about these games in my adolescent years, and a sense of importance about making products accessible. May he rest in peace.
-   And my ever-loving parents, for letting me live with them during the pandemic, and who gave me ample time and support to write this game over the last year or so.
