#unfinished 

## Hex Gratia

- sci-fi / sci-fantasy
- psychic witches and mutants
- hundreds of planets (but only one FTL portal can exist at any one time, so the wizards schedule it)

**inspirations:**
- firefly
- warhammer 40k
- star wars
- ghost in the shell
- lord of light

## Loke

- mythic bronze age
- weird and wonderful, and kinda gonzo
- dangerous summoning magic (every 'spell' is actually a demon)
- kind of also a sci-fi setting (there's lots of anachronisms)
- lots of playable species

**inspirations:**
- real world history, culture, and mythology
	- such as the mahabharata, popol vuh, mabinogion, illiad, and wuxia fiction
	- deliberately avoiding most christian / abrahamic influences
- glorantha
- morrowind
- exalted
- earthsea
- monster hunter
- studio ghibli
- stormlight archives

## Distant Worlds

- standard medieval fantasy
- ivory (white) and obsidian (black) magic (uses spell components and schools of magic)
- dimension-hopping
- isekai?

**inspirations:**
- final fantasy
- planescape / planewalkers
- amber
- pokemon

## Ire

- diesel punk (stuck between world wars 1 and 2)
- small desert and jungle world 
- vampires (ghouls) and were-beasts (si'lah)
- gritty and gory
- arabian (ottoman) gothic (russian) blending
	- need to be careful to not fall into orientalist tropes though 

**inspirations:**
- dune
- dark souls & blood borne
- hellboy
- diablo
