## Hex Gratia

- sci-fi / sci-fantasy
- psychic witches and mutants
- hundreds of planets (but only one FTL portal can exist at any one time, so the wizards schedule it)

**inspirations:**

- firefly
- warhammer 40k
- star wars
- ghost in the shell
- lord of light
- dune

## A Land of War and Poetry

## World of Ire

- diesel punk (stuck between world wars 1 and 2)
- alernative history
	- arabian (ottoman) gothic (russian) and imperial (japanese) dominant
	- need to be careful to not fall into orientalist tropes though
- vampires and werewolves and magic
- gritty and gory
- possibly set in the same world as King is Dead?

**inspirations:**

- dark souls & blood borne
- hellboy
- diablo
- underworld
