###### Author's note on spelling discrepancies

Despite being British, I've written Agora to use [predominantly American spellings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences) throughout, for a few reasons: 
- This is the *vastly more common* way of spelling words on a global scale, because most of the changes made by [Webster's 1806 spelling reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform) were designed to make the language easier to learn and use.
- And *it is easier*. I'm dyslexic, and American words are just easier for me to remember how to spell. They're generally more phonetic and shorter, which I like.
	- Still old habits die hard, and you may find the odd British spelling here and there.
	- Either way, both types of spelling are *technically correct* because the English language is [descriptive not prescriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description). 
- But also, unless the game ever gets translated to other languages, the United States has the largest English speaking population in the world, and is therefore my largest target market; so it behooves me to cater the game somewhat to Americans.
