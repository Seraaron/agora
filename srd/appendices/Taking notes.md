## How to take good notes?

> _Why do we take notes, you ask?_
>
> It's not to remember things, I can tell you that.
> No, **the point of note-taking is to think better**. Capturing notes is a _means to thinking;_ retention is merely a side effect.

_Note-taking is a skill._ Like all skills, it requires practice and upkeep. Our best recommendation for a taking hand-written notes _during session_ is called the 'outlining method':

-   **Outlining** means using single sentence bullet points and _emphasis_ to capture the most meaningful information
    -   then using sub-bullets to capture new or related information
        -   and using sub-_sub_-bullets to capture after-thoughts
            -   and clarifications
-   A more _advanced technique_ is called **[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)**
    -   which involves keeping your notes on _labeled index cards_, or using an application like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (not sponsored)
        -   and then tagging those cards to 'link' them to the tags of other cards
    -   but **this can get messy** if you try to do it during play though
        -   so try to leave the organization of your notes until after each session
-   Writing a **campaign diary** or **video-logging** can also help you to organize your thoughts, _and you'll be rewarded for doing so with [[Kismet#Earning Ego|Ego]]_
-   Outlining is easiest if you use a computer to take notes
    -   since you'll never run out of digital space
        -   and it's easy to come back and expand your notes later
    -   but outlining on paper is also possible, so long as you give yourself a bit of extra space
        -   or use a whole page per major topic
-   Remember, **the focus is on taking notes quickly and efficiently**
    -  and to serve as a reminders to *jog the memory of 'future-you'*
    -   so don't bother using proper spelling and punctuation *if you don't need to*

> ### Nb.
> You may now be noticing that _the whole of [[Agora]]_ is written with some of these note-taking practices in mind: Especially the use of **bold** and _italics_ to highlight the most important text, so that the key rules can be understood at a glace.
