# Using Checks and Tasks

Once your [[Agenda|agenda has been discussed]] with your [[Peers]], and it's clear that a roll actually [[When to roll dice|needs to be made]], your [[Facilitator]] will determine what kind of roll this will be — a **[[Checks|Check]]** or a **[[Tasks|Task]]**?

## Checks Vs. Tasks?

They both use the same rules for counting successes based on [[Rank|ability rank]], but they ultimately resolve a little differently:

- **[[Checks]] are generally quicker** — usually taking less than a minute of real playtime — **because they use only a few dice, and there are no external difficulty factors**.
	- You usually roll three dice, minus any [[Stress|stress]] in the chosen ability.
	- They're mostly used to try to complete _basic actions using simple verbs_, relying only on your raw abilities and sheer luck.
	- They have four main outcomes: _Failure, Partial Failure, Success, and Exceptional Success_.

Checks are great to use when a character's only obstacle between success and failure is their own abilities, and **they generally fill in the beats of most [[Session Structure#Scenes|scenes]]**.

- **[[Tasks]] take a bit longer** — sometimes taking up to ten minutes of real playtime — **because there's usually a lot more discussion beforehand**.
	- You usually roll dice equal to a [[Jobs|job's level]], [[Assets and Gear|assets or gear]], and other bonuses, and build up the difficulty out of multiple _[[Tasks#Set the Difficulty|factors]]_.
	- They can be used to achieve multiple objectives at once, or to achieve singular a objective on a much larger scale.
	- They have two main outcomes: _Failure or Success_.
	- Your _margin of failure_ or _margin of success_ — that is, the number of successes below or above the target difficulty — will only matter if it's established before the dice are rolled.

Tasks exist to accommodate the more complicated moments of play, and will chance the pace of a scene when you use them. **If you're using [[Session Structure#Turns|turns]], then it's best to punctuate turn with a Task roll.**

> ### Nb.
>
> Sometimes you'll be part-way through a discussion and realize that the roll should actually be a Check instead of a Task, _or vice versa_, or you might decide that the roll should use a different Ability or Job from what was initially decided. **This is _all_ okay.** You're still playing the game even while having these discussions.

### Heuristics

**Tasks often produce far more interesting results than Checks**, because they can be used to achieve much more complex and nuanced actions. _It would be possible to run the game using only Tasks_, but you'll probably have a much bumpier ride if you do. **If Tasks are the wheels of this game, then Checks are the suspension — smoothing out the experience of play**.

**Checks are vastly more useful during high-octane scenes**, where you want to pass the narrative [[Session Structure#Beats|beats]] around quickly, especially while exploring or fighting with a whole group of characters. **But Checks are also harder, generally, because you're rolling fewer dice.**

Games with less direct adventure and more political intrigue may end up using more Tasks to persuade and cajole others, or to have a duel against a single opponent. _Most games will use a good mix of the two_, or else find that the ratio drifts from session to session.

###### Pulling Back the Curtains

**A Check is really just a special kind of Task** — a simplified Task — _that has a lot of the options removed to speed up play_. When we break it down in this light, a Check is effectively just a Task that:

- Always uses a level 3 ability, or a 'pseudo-job' that can only be used to perform basic actions and does not earn exp.
- Always has 1 difficulty factor, making the total success target 2.
- Always cares about failure and success by a margin of 1, because of the partial failure and exceptional success components.

## Facilitator Styles

**It is ultimately your [[Facilitator|Facilitator's]] decision whether to use a Check or a Task** — or whether to just [[When to roll dice|say 'yes']] — for any given roll. The one they choose should mostly depend on the context of the current action, but it can also depend the campaign's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes*|tone]], or simply on their preferred [[Player Characters#Player Styles|play style]].

❗ New players will probably have to **spend some time while learning the game to _feel out the difference_** between the two types of roll.

**It's okay to make mistakes**, if you realize after the fact that something should have been a Check when you asked for a Task, _or vice versa_, because you''ll learn from that mistake for next time.
