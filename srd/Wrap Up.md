### ⏏️ Wrap Up

Wrap up meetings (also known as 'debreifs') are session segment that you should make time for at the end of every session. **Try to leave _at least_ 15 minutes.**

There is a required component to wrap up meetings for [[Agora]] — the [[Kismet]] rewards — and an _optional_ feedback component which is part of the broader [[Script Change Tools]].

After earning your [[Lots]], you have the opportunity to round the table again and just cover anything that happened in the game that you want to talk about and give feedback on, _from constructive to negative_. It's good to develop a Habit of talking these things through and [[Taking notes|taking notes]] so you can continue to improve.

> ### Eg.
> Someone might want to talk about an in-game moment that went over their boundaries, but they didn't feel comfortable stopping with a [[Script Change Tools#⏸️ Pause|pause]] or [[Script Change Tools#⏪ Rewind|rewind]]. Discuss _why that happened_, and what could be done to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Try to discuss game feel, plot choices, feelings of imbalance, improper character spotlighting, or mechanical disagreements. These are all valid talking points. Basically, use wrap up meetings to talk about anything that could be improved and how it the current implementation impacted the players or the FC.

Constructive criticism is great, but feedback is generally most useful when it's _descriptive not prescriptive_. That is, try to say how something made you feel rather than what you think the FC should have done instead, unless they specifically ask for that kind of input.

##### But Remember:

-   **This should be a supportive environment.**
-   **No one should tell you your feelings are 'wrong'.**
-   **Everyone is an equal in this conversation.**

During wrap meetings, it's also important to address anything that came up during the session that needs more discussion, even if it might be a hard topic. No one should be pressed to reveal their personal trauma or any intimate details, but they should be able to feel comfortable addressing issues that came up when they're ready.

> If you're not sure what to talk about, here's some suggestions:
>
> -   What emotions are you feeling and how do they connect to the session?
> -   If you're still learning the game, what are some ways that the other players could help support you?
> -   What lessons learned will you carry forth from the session today, or what is something you'll do differently from now on?
> -   Share a positive thought from the day's session and share an idea you might like to see in future sessions.
> -   Are you excited to play again?
