# Player Characters

A 'Player Character' (aka. a _playable character_ or PC for short) is like a fictional marionette that you control, and speak for, and otherwise inhabit to interact with the game world for the duration of a play session using your imagination. This is the primary act of _roleplaying_.

> ### Nb.
> **Player character's are usually the protagonists of the stories we tell**, _or members of the main cast at least_. Player characters are always either:
>
> -   Actively working on getting what they want,
> -   Dealing with some kind of conflict in their life,
> -   Fighting for something they believe in,
> -   Or undergoing some kind of change.
>
> We follow their point of view, through each triumph and disaster, for the majority of each session.
>
> By contrast, the characters that are not actively controlled by yourself or other players are called [[Non-player Characters*]] (NPCs), whom are typically controlled by the [[Facilitator]]. _They're more like the side cast_.

You create your PC in a process called '[[Character Assembly]]', which is a set of special rules that you engage with only during [[Development Sessions|development sessions]] to create a believable sapient being — assembled out of lists and choices, and stats and numbers.

**Then life is breathed into the character at the start of each [[Session Structure|session of play]] by speaking aloud their [[Principles]]**, _which you have hand-written to match the games current [[setting and situation]]_.

###### Playing Multiple-PCs at once?

In general, you can only control one character at a time, but you can theoretically have as many PCs as makes sense. That is, if they're all relevant to the game _and your [[Peers]] agree to let you have more than one character_. The more likely case is that your current PC [[Health#Dying with no Health|dies]] or retires and you'll need to make another one to continue playing.

> ##### Troupe-Style Play:
> Another option is to embrace the multiple-PCs route more fully. This is often called 'troupe-style play', as popularized by [Ars Magica](https://www.atlas-games.com/arsmagica), where you maintain _several characters at once_, including the FC, who you can switch in-and-out of sessions playing across multiple stories. You could even share a 'pool' of minor characters or [[VINPCs]] with your [[Peers]].
> 
> This is a more advanced technique though — certainly not recommended for beginners — and isn't necessarily enjoyed by every kind of player. Troupe-style play should always be discussed first in a [[Development Sessions|development session]] before trying it.
