# KISSing Dice

KISS is a double-acronym that _simultaneously_ stands for '**[[#Kismet]], [[#Insight]], [[#Stunts]], and [[#Specialties]]**' as well as '**[[#Keep it Short & Sweet]]**'.

**We say you may 'KISS' any dice that fail you**, when you roll for a [[Checks|Check]] or a [[Tasks|Task]]. This means that you must advocate for it, using one of the options described below, and if your [[Peers]] agree, then you may pick up that die, and _get ready to re-roll it_.

Once you've exhausted all your options or simply decide you've got enough KISSes, **roll all the dice you picked up and add any new successes to your total**, using the same [[Rank|rank]] as the first roll.

### Kismet

'Kismet', in this instance, mainly refers to **spending [[Lots]] and [[Ego]]**. However, for extraordinary rolls, [[Fidelity]] can also be used here _while KISSing_ for a special effect too:

-   **Spending a Lot lets you _re-roll a die_**, counting as a KISS _with no questions asked_.
	-   There's no limit to how many Lots you can spend on a roll, except that you only have eight, at most, at any one time.
-   **Spending Ego doubles the successes counted from all 6s rolled**.
	-   If your dice are  [[Exploding Dice|exploding]], then spending Ego will instead let you roll one or two bonus dice — equal to your [[Health]].
	-   These bonus dice can't also be KISSed, but they *can* also explode.
-   **Spending a point of Fidelity _temporarily advances_ your ability's rank by one step** (ie. 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1), until the end of the current [[Session Structure#Scenes|scene]], and that lets you _immediately count any extra successes_ that the new rank unveils.
	-   When you do this, be sure to change your partially filled kismet diamond to a fully filled one (ie. ◈ → ◆).

### Insight

**'Insight' means using special knowledge, secrets, or [[Specialties#Fact Checks|established facts]] to your advantage**. This is usually done by _referencing other things that have already happened in game_, rather than being something you can point to or spend from your own character sheet.

> ### Eg.
>
> -   Things that you've **discovered** _through play_, or things you're just now putting together in the moment.
> -   Drawing on **wisdom** that your character _should already know_, given their history or personality.
> -   Using **information** from a _previously established fact_, or by producing evidence that supports your claims.
> -   Cashing-in a **bonus** _carried forward_ from a previous roll.

Thus, the best way to use insights as valid KISSes is to **take lots of [[Taking notes|notes]] during play**. Which you _should already be doing_, as a good [[Peers|Peer]].

### Stunts

**Performing 'stunts' means describing your actions with extra flair, or acting in character with substance and ardor**. When describing or roleplaying out a stunt, you may add to the drama of the scene or raise the stakes, but the trick is to always try to frame what you've said in a way that still leaves the window open for you to fail.

_When you KISS a die with a stunt, the re-roll won't decide if what you've described or said really happens, but rather how the world will react to what you've just done._

> ### Nb.
> Another way of interpreting stunts is that you effectively describe what your character's _thinks_ they're doing or saying, and if the re-roll fails then describe what _really_ happened afterwards.

#important _Stunts don't need Peer approval_ in the same way that Insights or Specialties do. 

Stunts are quite potent, and so to limit their effectiveness: **Each roll can only be KISSed by a single stunt**, at most.

### Specialties

**Using [[Specialties|specialties]] means drawing on your character's trained skills and expert knowledge, innate knacks or natural talents, and special traits or personality quirks**. Each one needs [[Peers|Peer approval]]; so if the reason is not obvious to them when you mention it, you may need to _briefly_ justify it to your friends.

_Each valid specialty counts as a KISS,_ letting you re-roll a die, **but each specialty can only be used once per session**. (So remember to add a tick ✓ to the circle ❍ when used).

## Experience for KISSing

**The first valid KISS a character gives to a [[Tasks|Task]] roll also earns them a point of *[[Earning Experience|exp]]* in the job being used.** This is true for both the leader of the roll and for any [[Helping|helpers]], meaning that if everyone involved in the roll each gives it a KISS then they each get a point of [[Earning Experience|exp]].

## KISSing Limits

-   **There can only be _one round of KISSing_ per roll**.
-   **Each valid KISS lets you re-roll _one die_**.
-   **KISSing should be announced and counted from _all roll participants_ before actually re-rolling**.
-   **_Re-roll all the dice at once_, once you've got your KISSes.**

These facts combine to mean that _the most dice you can potentially KISS per roll is equal to the amount of dice you have for that roll_. 

Furthermore, when there is an [[Opposed Tasks|Opposed task]] or a [[Checks#Versus Checks|Versus check]], these restrictions prevent one side from re-rolling first, and then the other side using that information to decide how much to KISS.

#question Generally, **there's no point in KISSing a die that has already succeeded** — unless you're desperately trying to roll 6s to use [[Ego]] or cause an [[Exploding Dice|explosion]] — but if you do so and the second result is worse then you must keep it.

### Keep it Short & Sweet

This is the second definition of 'KISS' and it's use here is to remind you to not slow down the game's pace for too long while re-rolling: That **each KISS should be meaningful but brief**, _just like a real kiss_. 💋

> ### Nb.
> **You should keep these tips in mind when advocating for KISSes:**
>
> -   Use your _most obvious_ KISSes first.
> -   Mark off your kismet and specialties as you use them.
> -   Keep your stunt descriptions simple but effective, and your keep speeches on point.
> -   Don't dwell on a case if it's rejected, just move on.

While advocating, try to avoid semantic arguments about _what kind_ of KISS it is. This is most likely to happen with questions about “whether it's a stunt or an insight”, but it _doesn't really matter_.

In other words: **If you've agreed that it's a KISS, then it's a KISS;** _the final effect is the same_ regardless of the source.

#important Be careful not to 'double-dip': Meaning, if two or more things are _applicable but similarly-veined_, then only take one KISS.


#### What are 'Obvious' KISSes?

This is when you invoke an insight, or use a specialty that is applicable to the roll _without a shadow of a doubt_. You'll know it's obvious when just the mention of it gets immediate affirmation from the majority of the table.

> ### Eg.
> If you're a [[Mage*]], and you have 'Pyromancy magic' as a listed specialty, and you're trying to cast a fire-based spell, then that pyromancy specialty will be an obvious KISS, and no one should challenge you for using it.


##### Majority Rules

You only _really_ need to justify a KISS if _less than half_ of your friends are nodding their heads at you. There's no need to put it to a [[Peers#Peer Votes|vote]] or anything: Just give your reasoning, then read the room and see if you struck a chord.


#### No Tongue!

If a player is not keeping it short and sweet, we call that 'tongue'.

> ### Eg.
> When a player is dredging through their whole character sheet and all their notes begging for KISSes at every subheader; or they start rambling while describing a stunt; or they've run out of kismet and start asking if they should have earned any extra Lots or Ego from a previous scene; and so on.

A Peer may say “no tongue!” or “you're really tonguing it” if they think you're doing this, and _if the FC agrees_, then **the KISSing process stops short and all you can do now is re-roll any dice you've already picked up**.


## KISSing Strategies

**You can think of the four types of KISSes as benefiting four modes of play:**

-   **Kismet** benefits those who engage strongly with their principles, conditions, and features.
-   **Insight** benefits those who pay attention to the world building and small details, and who either have good memories or take lots of notes.
-   **Stunts** benefits those who like to immerse themselves in the roleplaying or the action, or who are good at improvising.
-   **Specialties** benefit those who prefer to optimize their character builds with lists of potential bonuses.

Meaning there's something for everyone. Rarely will your KISSes come exclusively from one source or another though, every roll will ideally use a mix of all four methods.

That said, there is _something of a strategy_ that will emerge if you enjoy using all four avenues:

1.  **Stunt** first, recalling that you can only get one KISS from a stunt.
2.  _Use your most obvious KISSes next_ — which are usually **Insights** or **Specialties** — to speed up play.
3.  And finally use your **Kismet** as a _last resort_.

### _Optional:_ Restricted Stunts

Only the FC may veto a [[#Stunts|stunt]] before it's rolled, if what you said is _too_ far-fetched or simply doesn't make sense within the context of the fiction or the [[Worldbuilding#World Rules|rules of the world]].

> ### Nb.
> Generally, your FC should **try to add to the description of a stunt**, slightly re-aligning it with what would be more reasonable, **rather than flatly denying it**. This makes the process more collaborative, and fun, and _encourages players to try to seek thrills rather than seeking permission_.

However, regular use (or over-use) of stunts can really change the game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]]. Some players may simply be better at stunting than others too, since it relies on real-life improvisational skills. So discuss with your [[Peers]] before play whether you want to further limit their use of stunts, by either:

-   Restricting them to only be usable **once per session**,

or

-   _Removing them entirely_ and reducing the acronym to 'KIS'.

###### Tongue-in-cheek Terminology

We sometimes use the word 'KISS' — pronounced  /kɪs/ — as an _adjective_, referring to one's advocacy for a re-roll; sometimes as a _verb_, meaning the action of the re-rolling itself; and even sometimes as a _noun_, in reference to a die that has or will be re-rolled. This somewhat loose definition should flow naturally at the table.

'KISS, 'KISSed', 'KISSes', 'KISSing', and 'KISSable' are all words that you end up seeing, saying, and hearing a lot while playing this game. But if you find the jargon is ruining your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes|tone]], then just call them 're-rolls' instead.

### Only KISS if You _Want_ to

Aside from making the fun acronym work, the use of the word 'kismet' at the start of KISSing should also prompt you to **think about your character's _personal destiny_**, and to ask yourself:

> #quote
> _What story does this roll tell me about my character's path forwards? If I were to succeed or fail at this exact moment, which way appeals most to me?_

With those questions in mind, you may decide _not to KISS_ after all and to simply accept your fate if that makes for a more appealing story. _But this decision is yours and yours alone_. Failure still has [[Difficulties and Consequences|consequences]], even if you chose that failure for yourself.

### Only KISS if You _Need_ to

Aside from the great narrative effects of KISSing dice, a useful side-effect is that **these rules generally speed up gameplay when KISSes wouldn't be necessary**. There is a natural tendency to want to draw on every advantage and to 'fire on all cylinders' at all times while playing games, but since _KISSes happen after the main roll_ and the target number of successes you need to pass is always pre-established, **you may find the success you want without needing to KISS**.
