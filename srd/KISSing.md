# KISSing Dice

KISS is a double-acronym that _simultaneously_ stands for '**[[#Kismet]], [[#Insight]], [[#Stunts]], and [[#Specialties]]**' as well as '**[[#Keep It Short & Sweet]]**'.

> #nb
> [[When to roll dice|When you roll dice]] for a [[Tasks|Task]], **you may 'KISS' any die that fails you**. This means that you must advocate for it, using one of the options described below, and if your [[Peers]] agree, then you may pick up that die, and _get ready to re-roll it_.
>
> Once you've exhausted all your options or simply decide you've got enough KISSes, roll all the dice you picked up and add any new successes to your total.

### Kismet

'Kismet', in this instance, mainly refers to **spending [[Lots]] and [[Ego]]**. However, for extraordinary rolls, [[Fidelity]] can also be used here _while KISSing_ for separate effects too:

-   **Spending a Lot lets you _re-roll a die_**, counting as a KISS, _with no questions asked_.
-   **Spending Ego doubles the successes counted from all 6s rolled** (excluding [[Die of Fortune|exploded]] dice).
-   **Spending a full gauge of Fidelity _permanently advances_ your ability's rank by one step**, and that lets you _immediately count any extra successes_ that the new rank unveils.

### Insight

**'Insight' means using special knowledge, secrets, or [[Specialties#Fact Checks|established facts]] to your advantage**. This is usually done by _referencing other things that have already happened in game_, rather than coming from something you can point to on your own character sheet.

> #eg
>
> -   Things that you've **discovered** _through play_, or things you're just now putting together in the moment.
> -   Drawing on **wisdom** that your character _should already know_, given their history or personality.
> -   Using **information** from a _previously **established fact**_, or by producing evidence that supports your claims.
> -   Cashing-in a **bonus** _carried forward_ from a previous roll.

Thus, the best way to use insights as valid KISSes is to **take lots of [[Taking notes|notes]] during play**. Which you _should already be doing_, as a good [[Peers|Peer]].

### Stunts

**Performing 'stunts' means describing your actions with extra flair, or acting in character with substance and ardor**. When describing or roleplaying out a stunt, you may add to the drama of the scene or raise the stakes, but the trick is to always try to frame what you've said in a way that still leaves the window open for you to fail.

If you're receiving [[Helping|help]], **an aiding ally may stunt in your stead**, and re-roll the helping die, if you can't think of anything to say or do yourself.

_When you KISS a die with a stunt, the re-roll won't decide if what you've described or said really happens, but rather how the world will react to what you've just done._

> #nb
> Another way of interpreting stunts is that you effectively describe what your character's _thinks_ they're doing or saying, and if the re-roll fails then describe what _really_ happened afterwards.

#imp _Stunts don't need Peer approval_ in the same way that Insights or Specialties do. This makes them quite potent, and so to limit their effectiveness, **you can only KISS a single die per Task with a stunt**.

### Specialties

**Using [[Specialties|specialties]] means drawing on your character's trained skills and expert knowledge, innate knacks or natural talents, and special traits or personality quirks**. Each one needs [[Peers|Peer approval]]; so if the reason is not obvious to them when you mention it, you may need to _briefly_ justify it to your friends.

_Each valid specialty counts as a KISS,_ letting you re-roll a die, **but each specialty can only be used once per session**.

You choose your specialties during [[Character Assembly]], either from a [[Specialties List|list]], or by making up new ones. And you can earn more specialties during [[Development sessions|development sessions]] via [[Peer Votes|Peer vote]], or during [[Campaign structure#Downtime|downtime]].

## KISSing Limits

-   **You can only KISS [[Tasks]], _not [[Checks]]_**.

-   **There can only be _one round of KISSing_ per roll**.

-   **Each valid KISS lets you re-roll _one die_**.

-   **KISSing should be announced and counted from _all roll participants_ before actually re-rolling**.

-   **_Re-roll all the dice at once_, once you've got your KISSes.**

These facts combine to mean that _the most dice you can potentially KISS per roll is equal to the amount of dice you have for that roll;_ and even then, you could only try to KISS them all if they all came up as failures on the initial roll.

Furthermore, when there is an [[Opposed Tasks|opposed roll]], these restrictions prevent one side from re-rolling first, and then the other side using that information to decide how much to KISS.

### Keep It Short & Sweet

This is the second definition of 'KISS' and it's use here is to remind you to not slow down the game's pace for too long while re-rolling: That **each KISS should be meaningful but brief**, _just like a real kiss_. 💋

> #nb
> **You should keep these tips in mind when advocating for KISSes:**
>
> -   Use your _most obvious_ KISSes first.
> -   Mark off your kismet as you spend it.
> -   Keep your stunt descriptions simple but effective, and your keep speeches on point.
> -   Don't dwell on a case if it's rejected, just move on.

While advocating, try to avoid semantic arguments about _what kind_ of KISS it is. This is most likely to happen with questions about “whether it's a stunt or an insight”, but it _doesn't really matter_.

#imp **If you've agreed that it's a KISS, then it's a KISS;** _the final effect is the same_ regardless of the source.

#que Be careful not to 'double-dip': Meaning, if two or more things are _applicable but similarly-veined_, then only take one KISS.

#### No Tongue!

If a player is not keeping it short and sweet, then we call that 'tongue'.

> #eg
> When a player is dredging through their whole character sheet and all their notes begging for KISSes at every header; or they start rambling while describing a stunt; or they've run out of kismet and start asking if they should have earned any extra Lots or Ego from a previous scene.

A Peer may say “no tongue!” or “you're really tonguing it” if they think you're doing this, and _if the FC agrees_, then **the KISSing process stops short and all you can do now is re-roll any dice you've already picked up**.

#### What are 'Obvious' KISSes?

This is when you invoke an insight, or use a specialty that is applicable to the roll _without a shadow of a doubt_. You'll know it's obvious when just the mention of it gets immediate affirmation from the majority of the table.

> #eg
> If you're a [[Mage]], and you have 'Pyromancy magic' as a listed specialty, and you're trying to cast a fire-based spell, then that pyromancy specialty will be an obvious KISS, and no one should challenge you for using it.

---

###### Majority Rules

You only _really_ need to justify a KISS if _less than half_ of your friends are nodding their heads in agreement as you mention it. There's no need to put it to a vote or anything: Just give your reasoning, then read the room and see if you struck a chord.

---

### _Optional:_ Disallowing Stunts

Only the FC may veto a [[#Stunts|stunt]] before it's rolled, if what you said is _too_ far-fetched or simply doesn't make sense within the context of the fiction or the [[Worldbuilding#World Rules|rules of the world]].

> #nb
> Generally, your FC should **try to add to the description of a stunt**, slightly re-aligning it with what would be more reasonable, **rather than flatly denying it**. This makes the process more collaborative, and fun, and _encourages players to try to seek thrills rather than seeking permission_.

However, regular use (or over-use) of stunts can really change the game's [[Genre, tone, and themes|tone]], and some players may simply be better at stunting than others; since it relies on real-life improvisational skills. So discuss with your [[Peers]] before play whether you want to further limit their use of stunts, by either:

-   Restricting them to only be usable **once per session**, or
-   _Removing them entirely_ and reducing the acronym to 'KIS'.

## KISSing Strategies

> #nb
> **You can think of the four modes of KISSing as benefiting four modes of play:**
>
> -   _'Kismet' benefits those who engage strongly with their principles, conditions, and features._
> -   _'Insight' benefits those who pay attention to the world building and small details, and who either have good memories or take lots of notes._
> -   _'Stunts' benefits those who like to immerse themselves in the roleplaying or the action, or who are good at improvising._
> -   _'Specialties' benefits those who prefer to optimize their character builds with lists of potential bonuses._
>
> Meaning there's something for everyone. Rarely will your KISSes come exclusively from one source or another though, every roll will ideally use a mix of all four methods.

That said, there is _something of a strategy_ that will emerge if you enjoy using all four avenues:

1.  _Use your most obvious KISSes first_ — which are usually **insights** or **specialties** — to speed up play.
2.  Then **stunt**, recalling that you can only get one KISS from a stunt.
3.  And finally use **kismet** as a _last resort_, since [[Kismet#Convert excess Lots to _exp_|excess Lots convert to experience points]].

###### Tongue-in-cheek Terminology

We sometimes use the word 'KISS' — pronounced  /kɪs/ — as a _noun_, referring to one's advocacy for a re-roll, and sometimes as a _verb_, meaning the action of the re-rolling itself, and even sometimes as a _different noun_, in reference to a die that has or will be re-rolled. This somewhat loose definition should flow naturally at the table.

'KISS, 'KISSed', 'KISSes', 'KISSing', and 'KISSable' are all words that you end up seeing, saying, and hearing a lot while playing this game. But if you find the jargon is ruining your game's [[Genre, tone, and themes|tone]], then just call them 're-rolls' instead.

---

### Only KISS if you _want_ to

Aside from making the fun acronym work, the use of the word 'kismet' at the start of KISSing should also prompt you to **think about your character's _personal destiny_**, and to ask yourself:

> #quote
> _What story does this roll tell me about my character's path forwards? If I were to succeed or fail at this exact moment, if it all hangs on the outcome of one die, which way appeals most to me?_

With those thoughts in mind, you may decide _not to KISS_ after all and to simply accept your fate if that makes for a more appealing story. _But this decision is yours and yours alone_. Failure still has [[Determining Difficulty and Consequences|consequences]], even if you chose that failure for yourself.

### Only KISS if you _need_ to

Aside from the great narrative effects of KISSing dice, a useful side-effect is that **these rules generally speed up gameplay when KISSes wouldn't be necessary**. There is a natural tendency to want to draw on every advantage and ‘fire on all cylinders’ all-the-time while playing games; but since _KISSes happen after the main roll has been rolled_, and the total number of successes you need to pass the Task has already been established, **you may get the successes you need without needing to KISS**.

> #nb
> Getting extra successes above the number of difficulty factors doesn't mean much _unless you pre-established it with an extra objective_, so if the main roll was a 'clean success' without the need for KISSes then you can almost think of that as succeeding ‘without breaking a sweat’, and you can even describe it as such, if you like.
>
> ##### _Optional:_ Clean Rolls
>
> Taking that thought one step further: Some groups may even enjoy treating such clean rolls as _'exceptional successes'_ that have bonus effects; but again, this will affect the [[Genre, tone, and themes|tone]] of your game, so be sure to always discuss it in [[Development sessions|session zero]].
