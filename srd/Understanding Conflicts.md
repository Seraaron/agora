# Understanding Conflicts

If you are finding that the [[Versus Checks]] system is too rudimentary, and that the [[Opposed Tasks]] system is too streamlined, or doesn't allow for enough nuances, then you may **consider using a full conflict system instead**. There are two core conflict systems in [[Agora]]: [[Martial Combat]] and [[Social Discourse]].

Each of these is best reserved for conflicts that directly involve the [[Principles|principles]] of two or more [[Player Characters]]. **Running a full conflict like this can take up to an hour or more of real life playtime** — and even more if you're still learning the rules — so it's important to pick your battles appropriately. _Not every barfight or disagreement needs to be this detailed_. Ask yourself "is it really necessary?", before you dive in too deep.

Depending on your game's [[Genre, Tone, and Themes]], you may only use a full conflict once per [[Campaign Arcs|campaign arc]], _or less_. In other cases, you may find yourselves hankering to use one of the systems every few sessions, _or more_.

###### Every Conflict Consists of These Components:

**Rounds & Turns**
Abstract units of time that ensure that every character involved in the conflict gets to act regularly. Depending on the type of conflict, a round could last _anywhere from a few seconds to a few days_. On your turn, you get to use a Move.

**Disposition**
A large number rolled at the beginning of a conflict that represents a combination of your initiative, physical stamina, mental composure, general standing, and your willingness to be involved with the conflict in the first place. _Disposition determines the turn order each round:_ From highest to lowest. It can be damaged throughout the  conflict and if the Momentum ever equals or exceeds your Disposition then you are vulnerable to being defeated by a finishing Move.

**Posture** (ie. Stances / Tones)
The ways that you can stand during the conflict, literally or metaphorically. They come as a symmetric triplet — aggressive, defensive, and counteractive — and every character _simultaneously chooses one_ at the start of each round. The stance you choose adds to the Momentum and also determines which Moves are available to you this round.

**Moves**
What you actually do on your turn. You choose a Move from the list of options decided by your current Posture. This gives a short description and guidance on what job to roll, what bonus dice to add to that roll, and what your target difficulty is. It also lists the consequences and effects of success and failure — which sometimes get applied immediately, but are usually applied at the end of the round.

There are eight Moves in every conflict, split into offense, utility, and finishing.

❗ Most offensive Moves will say “your opponent can exploit you” if you fail, which is an immediate reaction your opponent can choose from a list to hinder you with, to benefit themselves, or to raise the Momentum for everyone.

**Warding** (ie. Poise / Presence)
The _base target difficulty_ that all Moves must roll against to apply their effects. The calculation takes into account many different things, from job levels to assets, to situational or environmental benefits, and involves a division by two (rounded down). Thus, it is calculated at the beginning of  a conflict and rarely changes in the interim.

**[[Momentum]]**
A number that advances at the start of every round when all the characters involved choose their Stance. It can also advance _during the round_ when certain Moves say to, or when a move fails and an opponent uses a certain exploit. At certain thresholds, the Momentum starts granting increasingly more bonus dice to offensive Move rolls, called the +MD, which speeds up the conflict as the tension rises.

❓ We recommended that you use a [[Agora Momentum Grid.pdf|Momentum Grid]] to track the current Momentum, the corresponding bonus MD, and individual character's Dispositions.

### Other Types of Conflict

The two main system have their own full articles to read and learn from, but they are both structurally similar ([[#Every Conflict Consists of These Components|as seen above]]). Meaning that, with a bit of work, it's possible to create your own for settling something other than violence or debate.

The specific abilities and jobs used in all the rolls and moves mentioned above will depend heavily on the type of conflict. **Here are some suggestions:**

> ### Eg.
> 
> _Using mostly physical abilities:_
> 
> - **Single Combat:** Acrobat, Brawler, Martialist, Warrior.
> - **Tactical Operations:** Archer, Hunter, Skirmisher, Guard.
> - **Pitched Battles:** Commander, Gunner, Medic, Musician.
> - **Naval Warfare:** Commander, Mariner, Pilot, Wright.
> - **Racing:** Driver, Engineer, Explorer, Rider, Pilot, etc.
> 
> _Using mostly mental abilities:_
> 
> - **Private Dispute:** Beggar, Charmer, Deceiver, Investigator.
> - **Public Debate:** Diplomat, Orator, Philosopher, Steward.
> - **Magical Duel:** Alchemist, Mage, Priest, Illusionist, etc.
